## Overview

- Viruses need to spread to surivive.

- There is a minimum infective dose for viruses, that is, there needs to be a minimum amount of virions within a host in order to practically infect it. 

- Many animals are vectors for viruses, usually insects, sometimes vertibrae. 

- Viruses may face all sorts of immune responses, such as interferons, and restriction endonucleases (modifying own DNA so its unaffected by restriction enzymes). 

- There are 7 steps of virus replication: 1. Attachment of a virion to a cell 2. Entry into the cell 3. Transcription of virus genes into messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs) 4. Translation of virus mRNAs into virus proteins 5. Genome replication 6. Assembly of proteins and genomes into virions 7. Exit of the virions from the cell. **Idea: implement these into genetic algorithms.** 

-  Chapter 6 has been covered in genes coding for proteins. 

- These chapters didnt really cover spike proteins all that much, all I got out of it was that viruses bind to specific receptors.
