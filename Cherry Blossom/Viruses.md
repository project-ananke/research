## Overview 

- The structural functionality of viruses is dependant on the type. Bacteriaphages look like little machines. Conventional viruses are composed of a protein covering envelope with DNA or RNA inside. 

- Viruses bind to the cells membrane through spike proteins, then they enter the cell, then release their genetic material to infect the nucleus. Lastly, this infected material causes more viruses to be produced. They can also fuse in through the viral envelope. 

- Another functionality is their remaining dormant. 

- Cancer viruses and viruses that rewrite DNA are worth exploring. 

## Recap 

- Viurses are small carriers of genetic material, they mutate the more they are circulated, they sneak in through envelopes or spike proteins, their genetic material infects the nucleus, the final result is either a dormant provirus or replication.
