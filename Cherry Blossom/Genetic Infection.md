- Viruses infect the genes either as a DNA virus or a retrovirus. 

- DNA viruses can infect genomes through integration via viral enzymes, non-homologous end joining, and recombination. 

- Enzymes called integrases can cut the host DNA and insert the viral DNA into the host chromosome. 

- End joining (NHEJ) is a DNA repair mechanism which joins two broken ends of DNA. 

- Recombination sounds exactly how it sounds. 

- As for retro viruses, they take advantage of reverse transcriptase enzyme to convert its RNA into a DNA which codes for it, this DNA is then integrated into the genome. **Idea: Make actual computational models for this enzyme and the process of integration.**
