## Overview

- Viruses do not have chromosomes in the traditional sense, only segmented regions of genetic information. Their DNA or RNA mutates over time, the best practice would be to model rudimentary DNA structure along with the basic simulation of mutations. 

- Something to note is that the emergence of viruses precede that of archaea and bacteria. This is important to note as the complexcity of the form of viruses is greater than that of its function. The only meaningful model to come from level 0 intelligence is therefore DNA or RNA that mutates realistically. 

- The first few sections talk about the origins of viruses. It is not very important to consider this, however, details on origin may determine the host whom they infect, so perhaps this is worth investigating. 

- Most mutations, from the cause of individual genes changing, new gene combination, etc, are less successful than their parents and die off. Some are more successful though. ***Note: My vector model, if pursued, would need to allow for continous growth, success being orthoganility is not suffecient.***

- Viral genomes are replicated through the polymerase of its host. The replication isnt perfect and results in mutations. Selection is determined by selections pressures such as unique anti gens from hosts.

- DNA viruses have fewer mutations than RNA viruses due to proof reading. RNA viruses have quasispecies due to the massive genetic variation, mutation is common.

- 2 viruses infecting the same host can undergo recombination. both RNA and DNA viruses can do this. 

- Some retroviruses may have DNA gathered from their host. 

- Some viruses have genetic information that codes for protein that is very similar to the host body's protein, often midigating immune response. They probably get DNA from their host, probably when they replicate in the nucleus like herpesviruses. Some poxyviruses still exhibit this complex behavior though. 

- I will note the existance of viruses that mutate and jump species. When they do this, they're often times more virulent (deadly). 

- Co-evolution can occur, in which deadly viruses can become less lethal such that both can continue to evolve along side eachother. The ultimate example of this is when the viruses becomes permanently itegrated into the genome of its host. 

- The next enteries will cover Chapter 21, which is about emerging viruses.

- The Nipah and Hendra viruses are both RNA viruses which jumped mutliple species, from fruit-eating bats to pigs then to humans. 

- I will note that vectors are carriers of viruses to spread them, mosquitos are a good example. 

- SARS coronsviruses developed from a strain of mutations that allowed for human-human infection, this jump is surprisingly difficuly for viruses to make. 

- ***Note: Model should integrate mutation, recombination, and reassortment.*** 

- Viruses can kill you by exposing your body to other pathogens, an example being damage to the respiratory epthelium exposing you to more illness. ***Idea: simulate multiple viruses, perhaps a higher form of coevolution can take place.*** 

- You may have heard of H1N1, these refer to the combination of surface glycoproteins. Combination of H and N genes determine its name. H (haemagglutinin) N (neuraminidase)

## Form

- The form it takes is for the DNA and RNA mutations and replication, aswell as evolution. I will say that this falls under genetics, albeit rudimentary genetics.
