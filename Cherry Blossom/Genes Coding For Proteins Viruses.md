## Overview 


- The nucleic acid structure is either double stranded or single stranded. So ssRNA, dsDNA, ssDNA, etc. Most fungal viruses are dsRNA, plants ssRNA, and prokaryotes dsDNA. 

- The viruses genome typically codes for virus proteins, though others may code for the signals that control gene expression. This code is stored in nucleotide sequencing. In the case of ss RNA or DNA, it is stored within intramolecular bonds, for ssDNA it is GC and AT bonds. For ssRNA it is GU, GC, and AU. The resulting structure for ssRNA is called a pseudoknot. 

- RNA virus genomes act as mRNA once they enter the cell. 

- Some ssRNA plant virus genomes are folded and have similar structure to tRNA, which then promotes RNA synthesis. 

- sdRNA viruses have segmented genomes, which means that genetic combinations are possible, resulting in highly variant viruses. 

- Recall the transription is the transformation of DNA into mRNA, and that translation is the transformation of the nucleic acid bases language of mRNA into the amino acid base of proteins. 

- Viruses are divided by genome and method of transription. mRNA from virus is always +, nucleid acid with same sequence as mRNA is +. Nucleic acid complementary to mRNA sequence is -.

- The arrows denote transcription. Notice the arrow pointing from RNA to DNA, this indicates reverse transcription (retrovirus). 

- Pararetroviruses are DNA retroviruses. (Class IV)

- Dogma is a model of transformations basically. 

- The text makes note of some eukaryotic function, such as enhancers (sequences with binding sites ), promoters (the 'on' switch), and terminators (sequences which cause the enzyme to stop transcription). 

- Transcription occurs after transcription factors bind to sequences within promoters and enhancers. 

- A TATA box is a common promoter sequence in many eukaryotes. (TATAA/TAA/TA/G).

- Transcription factors are proteins that bind to promoters and enhancers, these help control gene expression. Some viruses create their own transcription factors. 

- An example of a transcription factor is IDD(TFIID), it binds to the TATA box, ater words, other general trancription factors bind. 

- Regulating gene expression is important for structured functions, herpesviruses have 3 phases, baculoviruses have 4 phases. 

- Transcriptase is a general term for enzymes that carry out transcription, viruses that replicate in the nucleus use the cells enzymes, viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm use their own enzymes.

- Above image describes the capping of transcription. 

- Translation turns information from RNA to proteins. page 102

- polyadenylation is the process of adding a poly(A) tail to an RNA transcript, this increases the stability of the mRNA, reoviruses dont do this however. 

- Some viruses have split genes. 

- Typically, most eukaryotic mRNA contain one ORF (open reading frame), and are monocistronic. 

- AUG is the typical start codon, some viruses use ACG though. 

- Some virus mRNAs can have multiple ORF, the functionality can vary, some function  as multiple ORFs, others as multiple. The functions form may vary, some have a 40S ribosomal subunit that overlooks ORF1 start codon, others encounter a frameshift signal and switch the reading frame. The frameshift results in a modified ORF1 protein.

- Protein modification can take place as glycosylation, acylation, phosphorylation. 

- Transportation of proteins can occur through post code amino acids, which specify it's destination. 

- For a virus to replicate in the nucleus, it must transport its virus proteins to the nucleus, a popular signal is PKKKRKV, which is a nuclear localization signals. This signal allows it to bind to the nucleus, nuclear export signals ensure that something like Rev and its RNA cargo for lets say an HIV-1 virus can be transported from nucleus to cytoplasm via nuclear pore. 

- I will not the existance of heat shock genes and stress defense systems. 

- Bacterial transcription and translation mechanism vary from that of eukaryotes, such as rho factors, sigma factors, Pribnow boxes, etc. ***Note: Investigate these later, I suspect they will be of moderate to great importance. (Section 6.8)***

- The above image shows all the different types of genome replication, I believe each arrow denotes an intermediary molecule changing the nucleic acids. 

- The location of replication vary from genome, though I dont think it is an important detail. (Section 7.2)

- For must DNA and some RNA genomes, a molecule of RNA or protein needs to act as a primer. Primers act as starting points for synthesis. 

- Section 7.3.1 speaks on the different protein primers for RNA viruses, I dont think this is important to take notes on. 

- Large genome DNA viruses encode their own enzyme polymerase, any virus in the cytoplasm needs to do the same. 

- Replicase is the enzyme for RNA genome replication. 

- Leading strand (short fragments that get stitched together, synthesized twice the rate of lagging strand). Lagging strand (synthesized continuously). Replication fork (fork structure in which unwinding and synthesis occurs). Ozakazi fragment (short sections of DNA formed in the synthesis of lagging strands, they allow for synthesis of both daughter strands).

- You can see above one replication process looks like a $\theta$, and the other looks like a $\sigma$. They are basically two modes of replication depending on the the replication fork. This is for double stranded RNA. This isnt an important detail. 

- I will note the existance of conservative and semi conservative replication for viruses. ***Note: This might be important when dealing with mutations--might; look into it.*** 

![[7.6.png]]

- ssRNA replication occurs through the synthesis of a complementary strand, the strand then serves as a template for synthesis of new copies of the genome. 

- Reverse transcription uses reverse trascriptase. ***Note: You can optionally investigate chapter 16 for retroviruses. I dont know how valuable that will be. Just something to think about.*** 

## Form 

- The form it takes is genetics and proteins, maybe this can fall under genetics and molecular biology, im not entirely sure though.
