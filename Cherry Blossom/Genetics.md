## Format 

- The organization of this will be as followed: It will provide a general overview of the subject, then will give a computational and mathematical treatment. Basically notes on genetics followed by mays to model and simulate it. 

- Only a general understanding is necessary, a conceptual understanding of the systems. The idea is to know enough to model it somehow. 

- Biology is about fractals, I will thus build up the system of genetics and its interactions. Starting from the most fundemental component of a gene itself, its chemical components of the nucleotides, up to nucleic acids, the structure of nucleic acids, to its functions, that being coding for proteins and regulation of gene expression. Its interactions are important, how it affects other systems within the body. 

- Structure -> function -> replication -> mutation -> how it varies across different genus (like viruses) -> how humans can fuck with it.
