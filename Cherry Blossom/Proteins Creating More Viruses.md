## Overview 

- Basicallt the virus codes for all the proteins to replicate itself.

- Explaining this image, we see proteins forming a procapsid, with replicated RNA or DNA coming inside of it. The new virus then exits the membrane covering itself with it to form a nuclear envelope, this is called budding. 

- Alternatively, you may have RNA that gets coated in protein then proceeds to bud. There are viruses which code for their own membrane, but I dont believe they are very common.
