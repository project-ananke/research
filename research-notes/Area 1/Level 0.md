# Virus
- Organisms with a strand of DNA having information on its genome, along with molecular structures for self-replication.
	- A protein shell that contains information for both DNA and RNA for self-replication. 
- Virus self-replicate by infecting healthy cells, forcing them to produce more copies. 
	- Theorized that a long time ago, a virus infecting a bacterial formed the first cell nucleus.
- Its components are to be able to sense if it approaches a host cell.
	- A basic sense of "food"  then leads to its reproduction--a basic sense and to follow what is essentially an imperative program. 
- Life itself can be defined by the ability to reproduce, produce energy for itself, and to maintain a stable internal environment. 
- **Paleovirology**: the study of extinct viruses. 
	- You can trace back viruses by finding examples of its genetic information within the genome of differing species, then allowing you to trace them back to their common ancestor, thus estimating the age of the virus. 

# Bacteria
- Humans have bacteria microbiomes that help us in almost a symbiotic relationship.
- Example: We offer shelter in exchange for them to help us, as in the case of gut bacteria.
	- Help us digest food—we tell our immune system to not attack them. 
	- Play large role in human condition, as 95% of our serotonin is produced in the gut, influence our happiness.
	- Influence our appetites by consuming certain types of food.
- Don't have a nucleus, instead having organelles. 
- Produce asexually through **nuclear fission** (essentially splitting apart).
- Some can create their own food, analogous to plants. 
- Carry extra genetic material in a **plasmid**—can be shared with other bacteria through **conjugation**.
	- If plasmid were to carry genes with anti-bacterial resistance, it would make other bacteria resistant to antibiotics (think MRSA).
- **Bacterial transformation**: when a bacteria is exposed to environmental shock, the stress can induce the bacteria to pick up genetic material. 
- Through sensory systems, bacterial can monitor their surroundings, abiotic or biotic. 
- Bacteria can adapt their behavior and physiology in order to stay alive and eventually reproduce. 
- The plasma membrane allows for acquiring nutrients, eliminating waste, maintaining a constant internal state. 
	- It contains a selective permeable barrier that essentially type-checks whatever chemical or ion it encounters, then decides accordingly depending on the material.
- Bacteria can generate energy and reproduce.
- Bacteria can organize themselves into complex structures which can form multi-celled
	organisms, such as **tissues**. 

# Yeast
- Commonly found fungus. 
- Can exhibit multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells (**pseudohyphae**). 
- Reproduce asexually through mitosis. 
- Gain energy through chemicle compounds such as sucros, fructos, etc. 
	- Can be used to generate electricity. 
- Can form communites where they can interact with their enviroment to further optimize the functionality of the yeast. 
- Can interact with other cells through the use of peptides and chemical compounds, forming essentially a type of language.
- Communicate in order to adapt to their enviroment. 
	- Perhaps yeast adapted to their enviroment by consuming more of sugary substances as how they were used by humans.
