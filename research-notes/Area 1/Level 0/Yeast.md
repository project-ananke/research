- Commonly found fungus. 
- Can exhibit multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells (**pseudohyphae**). 
- Reproduce asexually through mitosis. 
- Gain energy through chemical compounds such as sucrose, fructose, etc. 
	- Can be used to generate electricity. 
- Can form communities where they can interact with their environment to further optimize the functionality of the yeast. 
- Can interact with other cells through the use of peptides and chemical compounds, forming essentially a type of language.
- Communicate in order to adapt to their environment. 
	- Perhaps yeast adapted to their environment by consuming more of sugary substances as how they were used by humans.
