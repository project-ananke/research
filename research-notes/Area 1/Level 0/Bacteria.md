- Humans have bacteria microbiomes that help us in almost a symbiotic relationship.
- Example: We offer shelter in exchange for them to help us, as in the case of gut bacteria.
	- Help us digest food—we tell our immune system to not attack them. 
	- Play large role in human condition, as 95% of our serotonin is produced in the gut, influence our happiness.
	- Influence our appetites by consuming certain types of food.
- Don't have a nucleus, instead having organelles. 
- Produce asexually through **nuclear fission** (essentially splitting apart).
- Some can create their own food, analogous to plants. 
- Carry extra genetic material in a **plasmid**—can be shared with other bacteria through **conjugation**.
	- If plasmid were to carry genes with anti-bacterial resistance, it would make other bacteria resistant to antibiotics (think MRSA).
