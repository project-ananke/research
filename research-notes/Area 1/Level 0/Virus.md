- Organisms with a strand of DNA having information on its genome, along with molecular structures for self-replication.
	- A protein shell that contains information for both DNA and RNA for self-replication. 
- Virus self-replicate by infecting healthy cells, forcing them to produce more copies. 
	- Theorized that a long time ago, a virus infecting a bacterial formed the first cell nucleus.
- Its components are to be able to sense if it approaches a host cell.
	- A basic sense of "food"  then leads to its reproduction--a basic sense and to follow what is essentially an imperative program. 
- Life itself can be defined by the ability to reproduce, produce energy for itself, and to maintain a stable internal environment. 
- **Paleovirology**: the study of extinct viruses. 
	- You can trace back viruses by finding examples of its genetic information within the genome of differing species, then allowing you to trace them back to their common ancestor, thus estimating the age of the virus.
