We seek theories of intelligence and measurements of intelligence, as well as counterarguments to these measurements. 

## Theories

These are theories of intelligence that have been posed by major psychologists throughout the course of the centuries, ranging from a single number to an array of "intelligences."

- [Two-Factor Theory](Theories/Two-Factor%20Theory.md)
- [Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences](Theories/Gardner's%20theory%20of%20multiple%20intelligences.md)
- [Triarchic theory of intelligence](Theories/Triarchic%20theory%20of%20intelligence.md)
- [Spearman's general intelligence](Theories/Spearman's%20general%20intelligence.md)
- [Thurstone's primary mental abilities](Theories/Thurstone's%20primary%20mental%20abilities.md)

## Measurements

These propose general scales of measurements that could measure the overall level of intelligence. They, however, rely on the supposition that intelligence could be conceptualized and refined to a single numeric scale and, as such, have been met with immense criticism from the academic crowd.

- [Aptitude vs. achievement tests](Measurements/Aptitude%20vs.%20achievement%20tests.md) 

## Counterarguments

The counterarguments point out the fundamental flaws in the measurements, which are oversimplified by nature, confining the complexity of intelligence into, as is often the case, single scales such as a *g-factor* or IQ. These rebuttals demonstrate that intelligence arises from a multitude of factors, making human intelligence a complex and emergent system that occurs as a byproduct of both genes and environment. It calls into question the [reliability and construct validity](Counterarguments/Reliability%20and%20construct%20validity.md) of the measurements presented in the previous section and proposes external factors that may play a vital, though often neglected, role in determining intelligence.
