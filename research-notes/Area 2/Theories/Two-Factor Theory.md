# General Overview
- Developed by psychologist Frederick Herzberg. 
- Also known as **Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory** and **dual-factor theory**.
- Explains that there exists two mutually exclusive continua of factors that independently influence workplace satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
	- Factors encouraging job satisfaction encourage self-growth and self-actualization.
- Motivators (good crap like recognition, personal growth, etc.) vs. hygiene factors (bad crap like salary, working conditions, etc.).
	- Motivators encourage job satisfactionâ€”lack of hygiene factors also encourage job satisfaction. 
- One of the most used theoretical frameworks in job satisfaction research.
