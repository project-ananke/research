- Innovative tests in 1930s
- Tasks created for nonclinical purposes
- Point scale rather than age scale
- Non-verabl performance scale

# Point scale concept
- Binet scales were grouped according to age levels (group of tasks passed by 2/3 to 3/4 of individuals in that level)
- Not arranged according to content
- Only receive credit if certain number of tasks were completed (all-or-nothing idea)

# Non-Verbal performance scale
- Binet scale emphasizes language and verable skills
- Wechsler allowed for non-verbal skills
- Actively do something rather than just answer questions
- Perfromance: "longer interval of sustained effort, concentration, and attention"
