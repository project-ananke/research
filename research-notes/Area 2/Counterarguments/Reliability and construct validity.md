- Reliability implies external validation—being able to replicate and generalize your findings. 
- Construct validity talks about how well a the indicators reflect a concept that is not directly measurable, meaning how well the the measurements conceptualize the concept
	- Think about how IQ scores measure general intelligence—how well do they conceptualize intelligence?
	- Integral to the perceived overall validity of the tests. 
	- Constructs are merely abstractions made to conceptualize the latent variable.
