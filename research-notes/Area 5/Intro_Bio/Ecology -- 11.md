- Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their enviroment. 

- Some important parts of ecology are the population, community, ecosystem,  and abiotic factors. 

- Populations have characteristics such as number, density, dispersion or arrangement, and survivor ship curves. 

- The 3 types of survivor ship curve are either old dying with young surviving, all dying equally, or young dying and old surviving. 

- Age structure diagrams show the age distribution of a population, I will note that this is good for demographics which in the real world can drastically affect economic and social policies.

- Population growth can be modeled with exponential equations, or specific solutions to differential equations, these yields a growth which can take into account limiting factors and the population limit. 

- There are r-strategists and k-strategists. R produces many kids when there are lots of resources, where as K are usually at the carrying capacity, so the aduts usually survive to make many babies because of the fierce competition. 

- Within organism interactions, there can be competition which is what it sounds like, predation, herbivory, symbiosis which is the cooperation of two animals (unless its a parasite), and facilitation which is the effect of one species that results in another species' reproduction being altered. 

- Gross primary productivity is the amount of light energy that is converted to chemicle energy by photosynthesis per unit of time. 

- Net primary productivity is just GPP minus the energy used by producers for their own cellular respiration 

- Food pyramids are structures or diagrams that represent the flow energy from producers to consumers. 

- Food chains that show who eats who eats who are intertwined into food webs.

- Within communities, different organisms can be dominant which means their prevelance and infleunce is high. There can be top down and bottom up pressure, like how removing the apex predetor would increase herbivores, or how increasing minerals would increase the population of plants and thus herbivores. 

- Decomposers break everything down to recycle nutrients into the soil. 

- The rebuilding of a community after some destruction is reffered to as ecological succession. 

- A biome is a large region whos distribution is determined by the percipitation and temperature. 

- The water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle are all important.
