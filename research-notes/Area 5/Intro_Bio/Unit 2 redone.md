## Chapter 6 A Tour of the Cell

### 6.1 - Biologists use microscopes and biochemistry to study cells 

- In a light microscope (LM), visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses.

- Magnification is the ratio of image size to actual size 

- Resolution is a measure of the clarity of the image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as separate points.

- contrast is the difference in brightness between the light and dark areas of an image

### 6.2 - Eukaryotic cells have internal membranes that compartmentalize their functions Cells

- Bacteria and archaea are prokayotic cells, eukaryaprotists, fungi, animals, and plants have eukaryotic cells. 

- Inside all cells is a semifluid, jellylike substance called cytosol, in which subcellular components are suspended.

- Cells carry chromosomes which house genes in the form on DNA

- All cells have ribosomes which are organelles that produce proteins. 

- Eukaryotic cells have their DNA in the nucleus, prokaryotic cells have them in the nucleoid which is not enclosed in a membrane.

- The interior of both cells is called the cytoplasm. 

- At the boundary of every cell, the plasma membrane functions as a selective barrier that allows passage of enough oxygen, nutrients, and wastes to service the entire cell

- Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize their organelles. 

### 6.3 - The eukaryotic cell’s genetic instructions are housed in the nucleus and carried out by the ribosomes 

- The nucleus contains most of the genes in the eukaryotic cell

- The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus seperating it from the cytoplasm. It is a double membrane. 

- The nuclear side of the envelope has nuclear lamina which helps maintain its shape. 

- The nuclear matrix is a framework of protein fibers extending throughout the nuclear interior. The nuclear lamina and matrix may help organize the genetic material so it functions efficiently.

- Chromosomes carry DNA , the DNA is coiled in the chromosome by proteins. Chromatin is what makes up the chromosomes. 

- In non dividing nucleus there is a nucleolus which produces rRNA. 

- Ribosomes are complexes made up of rRNA and proteins, they produce proteins. 

- Ribosomes build proteins in two cytoplasmic regions: At any given time, free ribosomes are suspended in the cytosol, while bound ribosomes are attached to the outside of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope

### 6.4 The endomembrane system regulates protein traffic and performs metabolic functions 

- Many of the different membrane-bounded organelles of the eukaryotic cell are part of the endomembrane system, which includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, various kinds of vesicles and vacuoles, and the plasma membrane. 

- The membranes of this system are related either through direct physical continuity or by the transfer of membrane segments as tiny vesicles, which are sacs made of membrane. 

- The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is such an extensive network of membranes that it accounts for more than half the total membrane in many eukaryotic cells.

- There is the rough ER and smooth ER. The rough ER is studded with ribosomes. 

- The processes of the smooth ER include synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of drugs and poisons, and storage of calcium ions. It does this through enzymes that it creates. 

- Many cells secrete proteins that are produced by ribosomes attached to rough ER. For instance, certain pancreatic cells synthesize the protein insulin in the ER and secrete this hormone into the bloodstream.

- Most secretory proteins are glycoproteins, proteins with carbohydrates covalently bonded to them. 

- Vesicles in transit from one part of the cell to another are called transport vesicles. 

- In addition to making secretory proteins, rough ER is a membrane factory for the cell

- After leaving the ER, many transport vesicles travel to the Golgi apparatus. We can think of the Golgi as a warehouse for receiving, sorting, shipping, and even some manufacturing. I will note that vesicles are small sacs formed by a membrane and filled with liquid, their job is to transport substances in or out of the cell. 

- A lysosome is a membranous sac of hydrolytic enzymes that many eukaryotic cells use to digest (hydrolyze) macromolecules.

- Amoebas and many other unicellular protists eat by engulfing smaller organisms or food particles, a process called phagocytosis

- Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell’s own organic material, a process called autophagy. 

- Vacuoles are large vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. 

- Many unicellular protists living in fresh water have contractile vacuoles that pump excess water out of the cell, thereby maintaining a suitable concentration of ions and molecules inside the cell. 

- Summary: 
	1. The nuclear envelope is connected to the rough ER, which is also continuous with the smooth ER. 
	
	
	2. Membranes and proteins produced by the ER move via transport vesicles to the Golgi. 
	
	
	3.  The Golgi pinches off transport vesicles and other vesicles that give rise to lysosomes, other types of specialized vesicles, and vacuoles.
	
    4. The lysosome is available for fusion with another vesicle for digestion.
    
	5. A transport vesicle carries proteins to the plasma membrane for secretion.
  
	6.  The plasma membrane expands by fusion of vesicles; proteins are secreted from the cell by exocytosis

### 6.5 - Mitochondria and chloroplasts change energy from one form to another 

- Mitochondria are the sites of cellular respiration, the metabolic process that uses oxygen to drive the generation of ATP by extracting energy from sugars, fats, and other fuels. These are found in animals. 

- Chloroplasts, found in plants and algae, are the sites of photosynthesis. This process in chloroplasts converts solar energy to chemical energy by absorbing sunlight and using it to drive the synthesis of organic compounds such as sugars from carbon dioxide and water.

- Each of the two membranes enclosing the mitochondrion is a phospholipid bilayer with a unique collection of embedded proteins. The outer membrane is smooth, but the inner membrane is convoluted, with infoldings called cristae

- The inner membrane divides the mitochondrion into two internal compartments. The first is the intermembrane space, the narrow region between the inner and outer membranes. The second compartment, the mitochondrial matrix, is enclosed by the inner membrane. The matrix contains many different enzymes as well as the mitochondrial DNA and ribosomes. Enzymes in the matrix catalyze some of the steps of cellular respiration.

- I will note the existance of the endosymbiont theory

- Chloroplasts contrain green pigment chlorophyll

- Inside the chloroplast is another membranous system in the form of flattened, interconnected sacs called thylakoids. In some regions, thylakoids are stacked like poker chips; each stack is called a granum

- The fluid outside the thylakoids is the stroma, which contains the chloroplast DNA and ribosomes as well as many enzymes. 

- The peroxisome is a specialized metabolic compartment bounded by a single membrane. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that remove hydrogen atoms from various substrates and transfer them to oxygen (O2), producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product (from which the organelle derives its name). It sometimes breaks down fatty acids, alcohol in the liver, etc. 

- I will note the existence of unicellular organisms such as ameboes for future referance. 

### 6.6 The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that organizes structures and activities in the cell 

- The Cytoskeleton is a network of fibers within the cytoplasm. The most obvious function of the cytoskeleton is to give mechanical support to the cell and maintain its shape. This is especially important for animal cells, which lack walls. 

- Cell motility (movement of the cell) generally requires interaction of the cytoskeleton with motor proteins.

- Motor protein are basically like feat, they're used to walk along a track created by the cytoskeleton. 

- All eukaryotic cells have microtubules, hollow rods constructed from globular proteins called tubulins. Each tubulin protein is a dimer, a molecule made up of two components. A tubulin dimer consists of two slightly different polypeptides, α-tubulin and β-tubulin.

- Microtubles are what shape and support the cell along with guiding them. 

- In animal cells, microtubules grow out from a centrosome, a region that is often located near the nucleus. 

- Some eukaryotic cells have flagella and cilia. They act as locmotor appendages. A womans reproductive tract has it for example. 

- Microfilaments are thin solid rods. They are also called actin filaments because they are built from molecules of actin, a globular protein.

- network formed by microfilaments just to the inside of the plasma membrane  helps support the cell’s shape. This network gives the outer cytoplasmic layer of a cell, called the cortex, the semisolid consistency of a gel, in contrast with the more fluid state of the interior cytoplasm

-  Thousands of actin filaments and thicker filaments made of a protein called myosin interact to cause contraction of muscle cells

- The cell crawls along a surface by extending cellular extensions called pseudopodia and moving toward them. 

- In plant cells, actin-protein interactions contribute to cytoplasmic streaming, a circular flow of cytoplasm within cells

### 6.7 -  Extracellular components and connections between cells help coordinate cellular activities 

- Plants have cell walls which protects its cells agains the external world. 

- A young plant cell first secretes a relatively thin and flexible wall called the primary cell wall. Between primary walls of adjacent cells is the middle lamella, a thin layer rich in sticky polysaccharides called pectins.

- When cells stop growing they strengthen their wall with hard substances, but other cells add a secondary cell wall. 

- Although animal cells lack walls akin to those of plant cells, they do have an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM)

- The ECM is main up of glycoproteins, the most common of which is collagen. 

- Some cells are attached to the ECM by ECM glycoproteins such as fibronectin. Fibronectin and other ECM proteins bind to cell-surface receptor proteins called integrins that are built into the plasma membrane.

- Plant cell walls are connected by plasmodesmata. 

- In animals, there are three main types of cell junctions: tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. 

- At tight junctions, the plasma membranes of neighboring cells are very tightly pressed against each other, bound together by specific proteins. Forming continuous seals around the cells, tight junctions establish a barrier that prevents leakage of extracellular fluid across a layer of epithelial cells. For example, tight junctions between skin cells make us watertight

- Desmosomes function like rivets, fastening cells together into strong sheets. Intermediate filaments made of sturdy keratin proteins anchor desmosomes in the cytoplasm. Desmosomes attach muscle cells to each other in a muscle. Some “muscle tears” involve the rupture of desmosomes.

- Gap junctions provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjacent cell and in this way are similar in their function to the plasmodesmata in plants. Gap junctions consist of membrane proteins extending from the membranes of the two cells. These proteins create pores through which ions, sugars, amino acids, and other small molecules may pass. Gap junctions are necessary for communication between cells in many types of tissues, such as heart muscle, and in animal embryos.


## Chapter 7 Membrane Structure and Function 

### 7.1 Cellular membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins 

- A phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule. This means it has a hydrophilic and hydrophobic region. 

- Membranes are made up of lipids and proteins, with carbohydrates also playing a role. Phospholipids, the most abundant lipid in most membranes, are amphipathic molecules with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. They can form a stable boundary between two aqueous compartments by arranging themselves in a phospholipid bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails protected from water and the hydrophilic heads exposed to it. Many membrane proteins are also amphipathic, and are oriented in the membrane to maximize contact between their hydrophilic regions and water while providing their hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment. These proteins are not randomly distributed in the membrane, but are often found in specialized patches called lipid rafts, where they carry out common functions. The fluid mosaic model is a widely accepted model of membrane structure, but it is continually being refined as new research becomes available.

- Membranes are held together by hydrophobic interactions.
