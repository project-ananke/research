- There are 2 types of cell division, mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is responsible for growth and repair, it produces two identical daughter cells which are called clones but perserves the diploid (2n) chromosome number (number of chromosomes per animal, humans is 46). Recall that chromosomes are structures of DNA. 

- Meiosis occurs in sexually reproducing organisms and produces gametes (reproductive cells). This causes the cells to be haploid meaning they have half the chromosome number. 

- Chromsomes consist of highly coiled strands of DNA. A replicated chromosome consists of two sister chromatids, where one is the copy of the other. The cetromere is the region that holds the two chromatids together. The kinetochore is a disc shaped protein that attaches the chromatid to the mitotic spindle.

- Cells that divide go through a process of growth and division which is called the cell cycle. The rate of this varies per cell, for instance nerve cells never divide where as bone marrow cells are always dividing. 

- Uncontrolled cell division is cancer. 

- Recall the equations for a sphere, $A = 4\pi r^2$ and $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. As r increases the volume outpaces the surface area, since the surface area is vital for getting nutrients this can adversly affect the cell, so size is limited and this size determines when exactly it will duplicate. 

- The nucleus needs to be able to run everything effectively, so active cells are generally small. However, skeleton muscle cells have 2 nuclei and the slime mold fungus has several, so this can increase their size. 

- The cell cycle has 5 major phases, $G_1$, S,  $G_2$, mitosis and cytokinesis.

- Interphase is $G_1$ S and $G_2$. The $G_1$ phase is a period of intense growth and chemicle activity. S is the synthesis or replication of the DNA. $G_2$ is the phase of continued growth and preperation for seperation. 

- In interphase, the chromatin (building blocks of chromosomes) are thread like and non condensed, the nucleus has one or more nucleoli, and a single centrosome which has two centrioles can be seen in the cytoplasm. The centrosome is duplicated during S phase. 

- During $G_2-M$ transistion, the two centrosomes seperate and move to opposite poles. Plants dont have centrosomes but they do have microtubule organizing centers. 

- Mitosis is the actual DNA dividing in the nucleus. There are four phases to this, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telephase. 

![[phases.png]]


- Prophase: Nuclear membrane disintegrates, chromsomes condense and form, nucleolus disappears, and mitotic spindles (structures that seperate chromosomes) begin to form. 

- Metaphase: Chromosomes line up, centrosomes are positioned at the poles, spindle fibers run from the cetrosomes to the kinetochores (protein assemblies that connect chromosomes to microtubules) in the centromeres (region in chromosomes that spindles attach). 

- Anaphase: Centromeres seperate, spindle fibers pull apart sister chromosomes towards poles. 

- Telophase: nuclear membrane reforms and chromosomes cluster at opposite ends, chromosomes de coil, once the 2 nucleoli reform mitosis is complete. 

- Cytokinesis is the dividing of the cytoplasm, it begins during the anaphase. For animal cells, a celavage furrow forms (cell seperation indentation) as actin microfilaments (strand like structures from actin a globular protein) and myosin (a type of motor protein associated with contractions) interact.  

- For plant cells a cell plate forms, they dont seperate as a new cell wall forms between them and a sticky middle lamella cements them together. 

- Contact inhibition is the $G_0$ state, a state of no division as it is overcrowded. Cancer cells show no contact inhibition nor do they show anchorage dependance (the need for a cell to be anchored to something to divide). 

- Meiosis has been discussed. Some other facts about it are that the nucleus seperates twice and recombines so that each cell is genetically different from eachother. There is meiosis 1 and meiosis 2. 

- Meiosis 1 is called reduction division, it is when homologous chromosomes (one from mother one from father) seperate. Each chromosome first pairs up with the homologue intro a synaptomal complex via synapsis and forms a structure called a tetrad or bivalent. The alligning is important for crossing over to occur so genetic information is properly mixed.

- The synaptonemal complex is a zipper like structure which holds onen homolog tightly to the other.

- Meiosis 2 is when sister chromatids seperate into different cells. The 2 stages of meiosis are seperated into different phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. 

- Porphase: synapsis occurs, crossing-over occurs, and chiasmata occurs (visible manifestations of crossing over). This sets the stage for the seperation of DNA. 

- Metaphase: Homologous chromosomes are lined up double file in the metaphase plate, and spindle fibers from the poles of the cell are attached to the centromeres of each pair of chromosome. 

- Anaphase: The seperation of homologous chromosomes. 

- Telophase: Homolgous pairs continue to seperate until they reach the poles. 

- Meiosis 2 has the same phases. 

- There are 3 types of genetic variation from meiosis, independant assortment of chromosomes, crossing-over, and random fertilzation of an ovum by a sperm. 

- Independant assortment of chromsomes: When the pairs seperate, there is a 50 percent chance either a father or mother one will be picked, so there are many possible combinations (8 million). 

- Crossover: Recombination of chromosomes from the father and mother genes. Around 2 or 3 per chromosome pair. 

- Random Fertilization: there are 8 million possible gamete combos, so $8\cdot8 = 16$, so 16 million possible combos. 

- There are checkpoints to restrict division rate, the checkpoint in $G_1$ is R. The timing of the cell cycle is initiated by growth factors, like PDGF which is controlled by cyclins and protein kinases. 

- Cyclins are proteins that cyclically rise and fall in dividing cells. Theu are synthesized during S and $G_2$ and are broken down during M phase. Kinases activate other proteins via phosphorylation (the addition of $PO_3$). They activate only when binded to cyclin. So they are cyclic dependant kinases. Their binding forms cyclin-Cdk complexes, one particular one, the MPF, triggers cell passage from $G_2$ to mitosis. MPF is a maturing promoting factor. 

- Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF): an external signal that drives the cell cycle. Certain cells called fibroblasts have PDFG receptors. When they recieve a PDFG it triggers a signal transduction pathway which allows cells to pass the $G_1$ checkpoint.
