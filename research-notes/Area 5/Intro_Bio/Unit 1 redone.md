## Chapter 2 The Chemicle Context of life

- Organisms are made up of matter 

- An element is a fundemental constintuent of matter, several elements make a compound. (in a ratio)

- Trace elements are required by an organism in minute quantities

- An interesting note is that certaian plants evolved to handle toxic elements. 

- You should know what an atom is and its constintuents. 

- Different number of neutrons yield isotopes. Too many causes radiation and instability. 

- Electrons in the electron shell are what determine reactivity.

- The outer most shell is the Valence shell, its electrons, Valence electrons are what determine reactivity. Atoms with similar number of valence electrons 

- Electron orbitals are the position that they may occupy. 

- nonpolar covalent bond is when electrons are shared evenly. When there is a difference in electronegativity then they are in a polar covalent bond. 

- Ions are charged atoms, cations are positive anions are negative. 

- In the extreme exchange of electrons where one is ionized, you get an ionic bond, which can create ionic compounds (Salts). 

- Hydrogen bonds are when positive hydrogen atoms are attracted to electronegaive 

- Bonds based off the varying regions of charge are van der Waals interactions. 

- All of these weak interactions create large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. 

- The position of atoms' orbitals determine its shape. 

- Molecular shape determines how biological molecules respond to and recognize eachother. 

- Chemicle reactions are the making and breaking of chemicle bonds. 

- Reactants create products within reactions, these products in suffecient density can decompose and reverse back into its reactants, there are reverse reactions. When the forward and reverse reactions are happening at the same rate you reach chemicle equilibrium. 

## Chapter 3 Water and Life

- H20 is a polar covalent bond, as the oxygen is more electronegative than the hydrogen. Its charge is uneven and it is a polar molecule. 

- The regions allow for weak hydrogen bonds between other H2O molecules

- The hydrogen bonds hold the structure together which is called cohesion

- The hydrogen bonding to all the other water molecules but not the air molecules allows for high surface tension (how difficult it is to break the surface of a liquid). 

- Adhesion is the clinging of substances. 

- Cohesion from water molecules is what allows water transportation in plants for example. 

 - The specific heat of water helps moderate air temperatures. The specific heat is an emergent property from the strength of its hydrogen bonds. 

- A solution is the homegenous micture of two or more substances. The disolving agent is the solvent, and the substance is the solute. If the solvent is water, then it is an aqueous solution. 

- The polarity of water makes it a solvent, the sphere of water molecules around to sperated ions is a hydration shell. 

- Hydrophilic materials have an affinity for water, the opposite is hydrophobic (oil and stuff). 

- Molarity is the number of moles per liter

- An acid increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution. The opposite is a base. 

- pH is a messure of acidity. 

- The pH of cells is maintained at a certain level as the H+ concentration can greatly impact the chemicle reactions. 

- Buffers are substances that absorb or release H+ in order to maintain a steady pH 

- CO2 can lower the pH in oceans, this is called ocean acidification. 


## Chapter 4 Carbon and the Molecular Diversity of Life

- Compounds containing carbon are organic and are studied in organic chemistry. 

- The electron configuration of an atom determines its chemicle charateristics. 

- Carbon usually form one or 2 covalent bonds, these bonds can then branch out to form complex strucures. 

- An Atom's valence is the amount of electrons to fill its valence shell. 

- These carbon structures form carbon chains which are the carbon skeleton for many organic molecules. 

- Molecules of only carbon and hydogen are called hydrocarbons. 

- Hydrocarbons can undergo reactions that release a lot of energy. 

- Isomers are compounds that have the same number of atoms of the same element but different structures and thus different properties. 

- Structural isomers differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms

- In cis-trans isomers (also known as geometric isomers), carbons have covalent bonds to the same atoms, but these atoms differ in their spatial arrangements due to the inflexibility of double bonds

- Enantiomers are isomers that are mirror images of each other and that differ in shape due to the presence of an asymmetric carbon, one that is attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms.

- Organic molecules depend on the groups attatched to carbon skeletons. 

- Functional groups are groups responsible for chemicle reactions.

- An example of an organic phospate is ATP, it stores energy as the potential to react with water. It is made of an organic molecule called adenosine, which is attatched to a string of 3 phosphate groups. 

- Living matter is mostly cabron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. 

## Chapter 5 The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules 

- Macromolecules are large carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. There are chain like and are thus polymers. 

- The repeating unit making up polymers are monomers.

- The process of making and breaking down polymers are facilitated by enzymes, which are specialized macromolecules, typically proteins. 

- The reaction that connects a monomer to another monomer or a polymer is a condensation reaction

- A reaction in which water is lost is called a dehydration reaction 

- Polymers are broken down into monomers through hydrolysis, which is the opposite of a dehydration reaction. 

- Small variations in polymers are reflected in the differences between human relatives. 

- Carbohydrates include sugars and polymers of sugars, the most basic is simple sugars. 

- Monosaccharides typically have strucutures composed of CH2O. Glucose is the most common monosaccharide

- Monosaccharides serve as fuel for the cell, such as cellular respiration taking advantage of the energy stored in glucose. 

- A disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage, a covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides by a dehydration reaction

- Polysaccharides are macromolecules, polymers with a few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages.

- Storage polysaccharide are stored sugars used for later, for plants it is starch. This allows the plant to store glucose. 

- Animals store a polysaccharide called glycogen. 

- Organisms build strong materials from structural polysaccharides, planes use cellulose. Cellulose is used to contruct microfibule, a strong building block. 

- very few organisms can digest cellulose. 

- Chitin is another polysaccharide used by arthropods to contrust their exoskeletons. 

- Lipids is a class of biological molecule that doesnt have true polymers, they are hydrophobic. 

- A fat consists of a glycerol molecule joined to three fatty acids

-  A fatty acid has a long carbon skeleton, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. The carbon at one end of the skeleton is part of a carboxyl group, the functional group that gives these molecules the name fatty acid.

- Fatty acid with no double bonds between carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen and is thus called saturated fatty acid. 

- An unsaturated fatty acid has multipled bonds. 

- Trans fats are hydrogenated unsaturated fats that produce trans double bonds. 

- A phospholipid is similar to a fat molecule but has only two fatty acids attached to glycerol rather than three.

- Steroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings.

- Cholesterol is an important steriod and is used by animals in cell membranes. 

- All proteins are constructed from the same 12 amino acids, they serve an important role in the body. 

- Peptide bonds are bonds between amino acids. 

- A polymer of amino acids is a polypeptide. 

- A protein is a biologically functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides, each folded and coiled into a specific threedimensional structure

- An amino acid is an organic molecule with both an amino group and a carboxyl group. The center of the amino acid is an alpha carbon 

- When two amino acids are positioned so that the carboxyl group of one is adjacent to the amino group of the other, they can become joined by a dehydration reaction, with the removal of a water molecule. The resulting covalent bond is called a peptide bond. Repeating this yields a polypeptide

- The proteins specific strucutre determines its characteristics, the synthesis is polypeptides can cause folding creating a shape. 

- The primary structure of the protein is the suequence of amino acids, the secondary structure is a region stablized by hydrogen bonds, the coils and folds are what make up the secondary structure. The tertiary structure is the general shape of the polypeptides via the interactions of the side chains of the amino acids. 

- Covalent bonds called disulfide bridges may further reinforce the shape of a protein.

- Some proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains aggregated into one functional macromolecule. Quaternary structure is the overall protein structure that results from the aggregation of these polypeptide subunits.

- These emerging properties basically just produce a cell, just imagine these constintuents building on each other, even one single flaw like the wrong amino acid in the primary layer can cause diseases. An example being sickle-cell disease. 

- Protein folding determines structure. 

- Denaturation is when changes in enviroment cause a change in protein shape. 

- . The method most commonly used to determine the 3-D structure of a protein is X-ray crystallography, which depends on the diffraction of an X-ray beam by the atoms of a crystallized molecule.

- Genes consist of DNA which is a nucelid acid. These genes determine the primary strucuture. 

-  Nucleic acids are polymers made of monomers called nucleotides.

- Genes tell the cell how to make complex components, RNA specifically is in charge of directing protein synthesis. This entire process is called gene expression. 

- DNA uses mRNA to tell the body how to make proteins. 

- Nucleic acids are macromolecules that exist as polymers called polynucleotides

- Each polynucleotide consists of monomers called nucleotides. 

- The nitrogenous bases have 2 rings of nitrogen atoms. There are 2 bases, pymridine, and purine. These bases, a phosphate group, and a sugar make up nucleotides. 

- A pyrimidine has one six-membered ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms. The members of the pyrimidine family are cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U)

- Purines are larger, with a six-membered ring fused to a fivemembered ring. The purines are adenine (A) and guanine (G). The specific pyrimidines and purines differ in the chemical groups attached to the rings

- The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, in RNA it is ribose.

- DNA takes the shape of a double helix, it has a sugar-phosphate backbone. The 2 strands are held together by hydrogen bonds. 

- RNA is just a single strand. 

- Bioinformatics uses computers to analyze biological data. 

- Genomics analyzes genes and proteomics analyzes proteins.
