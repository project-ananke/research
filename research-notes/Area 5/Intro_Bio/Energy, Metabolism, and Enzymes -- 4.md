- Energy is the ability to do work, there is kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, and chemical energy. 

- The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can not be created or destroyed. 

- The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy (disorder) of a system always increases. 

- The energy of a system is defined by the Gibb's free energy or just free energy, all this is the portion of energy that can do work within a system in this context a cell. 

- If energy is released in a reaction, it is caulled exergonic or exothermic. This means that $\Delta G < 0$, where G is the free energy. 

- If energy is absorbed then it is endergonic or endothermic, which means that $\Delta G > 0$. In complex reactions, exergonic power endergonic reactions. 

- Metabolism is the sum of all chemicle reactions that take place in the cell. Catabolism is when it breaks down molecules, and anabolism is when it build up molecules. These reactions take place in pathways or sequential steps. These pathways are controlled by enzymes, recall that enzymes aggravate and catalzye reactions. 

- Enzymes work by orienting molecules in positions that favor reactions to occur. They serve as catalytic proteins that speed up reactions by lowering the energy of activation, which is the energy needed to start a reaction. 

- The transition state of a endergonic reaction is the condition of 

- Enzymes are globular proteins that exhibit tertiary structure (the structure at which polypeptide chains become functional). 

- Enzymes are substrate specific. Basically the enzyme can only act on certain substances. 

- The induced fit model describes how enzymes work, when substrates enter the active site, it inudces the enzyme to change its shape so the substrate fits better.

- When enzymes bind to substrates they form enzyme-substrate complexes. 

- Enzymes are reused during reactions rather than destroyed. 

- Enzymes are named after their substrate and end is "ase."

- Enzymes catalyze reactions in both directions. 

- Enzymes often require assistance from inorganic cofactors or coenzymes. Coenzymes are just vitamins. 

- Enzyme effectiveness is determined by pH and temperature. 

- Competitive and noncompetitive inhibition is used to regulate created enzymes. Turning on and off genes is used to regulate the production of enzymes. 

- Competitve inhibition is when compounds are made to mimick substrates which then compete with enzymes, thus limiting their affect on reactions. 

- Some enzymes are allosteric, meaning that a change in shape affects its effeciency. 

- Within noncompetitive inhibition, special molecules called noncompetitive inhibitors or allosteric regulators, bind to sites on the allosteric enzyme away from its active site. The binding then causes it to change shape in such a way that it can no longer turn subtrates into products. 

- In feedback inhibition, the products from the enzyme catalzying the subtrates serves as the allosteric regulator.

- Cooperativity is a allosteric activation (increases the attractiveness of an enzyme via binding). When an enzyme with inactive subunity binds with a substrate, it causes all the other subunits to become active.
