## Chapter 1:

- Biologally is broken down into structures, this is further studied within systems biology 

- Eukaryotic cells have DNA-containing nucleus and other membran enclosed organelles. Prokaryotic cells lack such organelles. Genetics is encoded within the nucleotide sequences of DNA, (gene), genes are transcribed into mRNA which then tell the body what specific proteins to make, this process is called gene expression. Genomics studies this at a larger scale. Bioinformatics studies this as well but by using computers. 

- Energy is always flowing, producers turn sunlight to chemicle engergy, consumers then take this energy to produce work. 

- Feedback regulation is the regulation of producting based off volume, negative feedback slows it, positive feeback speeds up the production. 

- Life emerges due to a phenomenon called evolution, in which species change and are picked out by natural selection, in which the strongest creatures and thus traits are passed on. 

- Theories are made which are then studied, experimented, and reproduces, the emperical data is then used to make predictions or develop theories. 

- Technology and communication are key within science. 

- Organisms on a campus make up a community. Ecosystems are set groups of creatures who have their own bubble of life and dependance on each other, a population is the number of organisms, and a taxonomic domain is the overarching superset for different types of organisms. Domain Bacteria and domain Archaea consist of prokaryotes, where as domain eukarya consist of the eukayotes. Just think of this description as being based off the biology of the consintuent cells of all these creatures. 

- Unity is the similarity of the cellular biology of animals, particularly in DNA. 

- Hypothesis are smaller scale than theories. 


## Chapter 2 The Chemical Context of Life: 

- Elements are fundemental consintuents of matter. A compound consists of multiple elements 

- Atoms have an atom number or number of protons, a mass number whihc is measured in daltons (u) and is the sum of neutrons and protons. Isotopes are differing levels of neuetrons, its increased mass can cause it to be unstable and give off radiation.  Electrons exist at different energy levels within its orbital cloud, the valence shell is reactive, it is the outermost shell. 

- The completion of the valence shell with interacting atoms is what causes reactions, covalent bonds form when pairs of electrons are shared. 

- Molecules consist of multiple covalently bonded atoms, the atom-electron attraction is called electronegativety, if the atoms are the same they have a nonpolar covalent bond as their electronegativity is the same. I will note that electrons are shared evenly in nonpolar covalent bonds.  

- Ions are charged atoms, two oppositely charged ions may form an ionic bond. 

- Weak interactions effect the shape of large molecules. Can der Waals interactions occure between postive and negative regions of molecules, this could cause things like hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding is not caused by sharing electrons but instead through interacting partial charges. 

- The position of valence orbitals determine a molecules shape.

- Chemicle reactions turn reactants into products whilst conserving matter. Chemicle equilibrium is when forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. These forward and reverse describe the process of reactants turning into products or the reactants from products turning back into its original form. 

- Trace elements are found within animals in very small amounts, they're important for functionality. 

- The reactivity of an atom arises from the number of valence electrons. 

- aninions have more electron than protons whereas cations are the opposite. 

- Hydrogen bonds with sulfur to form H2S, this process is covered further in chemistry. 


## Chapter 3: Water and Life: 

- Water is a polar molecule (has regions of positive and negative charge)

- Hydrogen bonding effects cohesion and surface tension within water. (resistance to deformation). I talso gives rise to the specific heat of water. 

- Breaking hydrogen bonds effect specific heat, and forming hyrdrogen bonds cause specific heat. 

- Molarity is a meassure of moles per unit liter, moles are just numbers used to meassure massive quanitities like molecules. 

- The properties of water can be further researched in fluid dynamics. 

- The concentration of positive hydrogens are meassure by pH. High pH is a base, low pH is acidic. Acidic base pairs called buffers can resist change to pH levels. 

- Wax is a hydrophobic material meaning that it is non soluable and is basically water resistant. 


## Chapter 4 Carbon and the Molecular Diversity of Life: 

- Organic chemistry can be used to synathize organic compounds within labs. 

- Living matter is mostly comprised of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. 

- Carbon bonding with other atoms such as Oxygen, Hydroge, and Nitrogen can form the basic building blocks for life. Hydrocarbons consist of carbon and hydrogen. 

- Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are structural isomers, cis trans isomers, and enantiomers. 

- Structural isomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms in their molecules. For example, butane and 2-methylpropane are structural isomers. They both have the molecular formula C4H10, but the atoms are arranged differently in their molecules.

- Stereoisomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula and the same arrangement of atoms, but the atoms are arranged in a different spatial orientation. There are two main types of stereoisomers: enantiomers and diastereomers. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other, like your left and right hand. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other.

- Cis isomers are stereoisomers in which the atoms or groups of atoms on either side of a double bond or ring are on the same side. In trans isomers, the atoms or groups of atoms on either side of a double bond or ring are on opposite sides. For example, consider the compound 1,2-dichloroethylene. It has two isomers: cis-1,2-dichloroethylene and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. The cis isomer has the chlorine atoms on the same side of the double bond, while the trans isomer has the chlorine atoms on opposite sides. These two isomers have different physical and chemical properties.

-  Enantiomers are a type of stereoisomer that differ only in the way that their atoms are oriented in space. They have the same molecular formula and the same arrangement of atoms, but the atoms are arranged in a way that is a mirror image of each other. (think of left hand vs right hand)

- Organic chem is the study of natural compounds, or carbon compounds. 

- Functional groups within organic chemstry are the chemicle groups which are responsible for the specific characteristics of the way it reacts. 

- An example of an asymetric carbon pair is one in which one of its bonds is unlike the other carbon molecules next to it. 

## Chapter 5 The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules: 

- Large carbohydrates, proteisn, and nuceleic acids are polymers, chains of monomers (small simple molecules such as simple sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides which are teh building blocks of DNA and RNA). These monomers form larger molcules via dehydration reactions (a reaction in which 2 molecules are bonded via the removal of a water molecule)

- Carbohydrates are fuel and building material within the cell. Such as cellulose strengthing plant walls, starch storing glucose for energy, etc. 

- Lipids are hydrophobic molecules, they serve as an important energy source and as bilayers for certain membranes. 

- Proteins have diversity in strucuture, resulting in a wide range of functions. These proteins store amino acids, transport substances, function in cell movement, and perform other functions. Some examples of proteins are enzymes, hormones, and motor proteins. 

- Nucleic acids store, transmit, and help express hereditary information. It serves functions in gene expression (information in gene is used to produce a functioning product, such as a protein. )

- Some examples within DNA are deoxyribos, there as well exist other examples within RNA. 

- Bioinformatics contain genomics and proteomics, which use computational tools to analyze large sets of genes and proteins respectively. 

- Startch, disaccharide, and polysaccharide are all considered carbohydrates. 

- Enzyme amylase are enzyms that break down carbohydrates, it specifically brekas down hycosidic linkaes, which are chemicle bonds that link monomers together to form polymers. These monomers here are glucose molecules which are simple sugars. Alpha form refers to the speficic arrangement of the atoms in the glucose molecule. Alpha forms and beta forms are the 2 main forms of glucose, alpha is more stable than beta. The enzyme amylase is most effective at breaking down glycosidic linkages in the alpha form. Amylase is an important enzyme that is involved in the digestion of carbohydrates. It is produced by the pancreas and the salivary glands, and it helps to break down complex carbs into simpler sugars that can be absorbed by the body. 

- The enzym amylase can break down glycogen, starch, and amylopectin, it cant for example break down cellulose as it is a major component in plant cell walls and is not digestable by humans. 

- unsaturated fats have double bonds in their fatty acid chains. Unsaturated fat is a fat that is liquid at room temperature and is usually found in plant based foods. It has double bonds and is thus less saturated with hydrogen atoms. The fatty acid chains are long chains of carbon bonded with hydrogn and are major component in the structure of fats. 

- The primary level of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the protein. It is the most basic level of protein structure, and it is determined by the genetic code. The secondary level of a protein refers to the way that the amino acid chain folds and assumes a specific shape. This level of protein structure is held together by hydrogen bonds and is important for the function of the protein. The tertiary level of a protein refers to the way that the protein folds into a three-dimensional structure. It is held together by a variety of chemical bonds, including hydrogen bonds, and is important for the function of the protein. The quaternary level of a protein refers to the way that multiple protein subunits come together to form a complex. It is held together by a variety of chemical bonds, including hydrogen bonds, and is important for the function of the protein. The primary level is least affected by disruptions in hydryogen bonding. 

- Enzymes that break down DNA (double stranded molecule that contains genetic information) catalyze the hydrolysis of the covalent bonds that join nucleotides together. The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides which are joined together through covalent bonds (sharing electrons). Hydrolysis is a chemicle reaction in which a molecule is broken down into smaller molecules via the addition of water. Certain enzymes that break down DNA do so through this technique. Specifically what happens is that the phosphodiester linkaes of the polynucleotide back bone would be broken. The DNA strands are held together by covelant bonds called phosphodiester linkages, these linkages are located within the backbone of the DNA molecule.
