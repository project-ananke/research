- Characteristics are passed down by genes. 

- Multiply two probabilities together to calculate the chance of both the independant events happening. 

- Add the probabilities when it is either or. 

- The law of dominance basically states that a child will be a hydrid of its parents genes but will have a dominant and recessive trait. 

- Alternative versions of a gene are called alleles. 

- The law of segregation states that when gamates are formed the parent trait splits in two. 

- A monohybrid cross is the cross between two organisms which are hybrid of a trait. A phenotype relates to appearance, the genotype refers to the type of gene. 

- Homozygot means it has a pair of identical alleles. 

- Heterozygote means it has 2 different alleles per gene. 

- The phenotype ratio from lets say a tall and dwarf plant is 3:1. The genotype ratio is 25 percent homozygous, 50 percent heterozygous, and 25 percent homozugous recessive. 1:2:1

- The testcross or backcross is a way to determine the genotype of an individual plant or animal showing only the dominant trait. The creature B is cross with a homozugous recessive creature bb. 

- If B is is homozygous dominant all the offspring will be Bb, if B is hybrid (Bb), then 1/2 of the offspring will have the recessive trait. 

- The law of independant assortment applies when the cross is carried out between two individuals hybrid for two or more traits that are not on the same chromosome. This is calle a dihybrid cross. 

- The law states that during gamate formation the alleles of a gene for one trait segregate independantly from the alleles of a gene for another trait. 

- Segregation and independant assortment apply to genes on different chromosomes. 

- The only factor that determines how alleles segregate is how the homologous pairs line up in the metaphase of meiosis 1, which is random. 

- Genes that are adjacent and close to eachother on the same chromosome tend to move as a unit and not segregate. 

- When there exists parents of AA BB genes, with another parent of aa bb genes, and their kids are then Aa Bb, then any cross with them is a dihybrid cross. This creates unique combinations.

- Mendelian principles (everything I just noted) apply only to traits determined by a single gene for which only has 2 alleles. 

- Incomplete dominance is characterized by blending, basically since neither or dominant they are denoted by capital letters and the resulting traits create a blend. For instance a black and white animal creating a gray animal. 

- Codominance is when both traits show, this is most prominent is human blood groups where several molecules can show. 

- There can be multiple alleles for one gene, again, all the different blood types of humans is a good example of this. 

- Many traits are the product of multiple genes. 

- Polygenic inheritance is when traits are based on a multitude of different genes, such as height, skin pigmentation, and hair color. This is why sometimes short people have tall kids. 

- Genomic imprinting and extranuclear genes are exceptions to mendelian inheritance. 

- Genomic imprinting is when there is a variation in the phenotype depending on whether a trait is inherited from the mother or father, it is caused by the methylation of DNA during gamate formation, this silences an allele. 

- Extranuclear genes are located in the mitochondria and chloroplasts. The mothers genes are purely passed on as the fathers mitochondria DNA isnt within the egg. 

- The enviroment can have an affect on how genes are expressed. This idea is within "nature and nurture. "

- Penetrance is the proportion of individuals in a group with a given genotype which actually shows the expected phenotype. 

- Linked genes are genes that are on the same chromosome, since there are 46 chromosomes, there are 46 linkage groups. 

- Sex-linked traits are located on the X chromosome. 

- Males are XY and females are XX. 

- If a sex linked trait is due to a recessive mutation, a female will express the phenotype only if she cares two mutates genes. 

- If she caries only one mutated gene then she is a carrier. 

- If the sex linked trait is due to a dominant mutation, a female will express the phenotype with only one mutated gene. 

- Some traits are not sex-linked but are instead sex-limited, where expression depends on the sex of the individual. Human males cannot produce milk even though they have mammary glands.

- Some examples of recessive sex linked traits are color blindess and hemiophilia. 

- Sons cant inherit a sex linked trait from the father because the son inherits the Y chromosome from the father. 

- There is no carrier state for X-linked traits in males. If a male has the gene, he will express it. 

- It is uncommon for a female to have a recessive sex-linked condition. In order to be affected, she must inherit a mutant gene from both parents.

- Crossovers are when 2 genes far apart from eachother on the chromosome get seperated during meiosis. At the sight at which the crossover and recombination happen is a chiasma, a physical bridge built around the point of exchange. 

- The result of a crossover is a recombination. Genetic recombination is the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either P generation parent. 

- The probability that genes on the same chromosome will segregate as a unit is a function of the distance between the genes.

- A genetic map is an ordered list of genetic loci along a particular chromosome. The percentage of recombinant offspring is the recombination frequency. 

- A linkage map is a genetic map based on the recombination frequencies. 

- The distances between genes are map units, you define one map unit as equivelant to a 1% recombination frequency. 

- The recombination frequency = the number of recombinations divided by the total number of ofspring, all multiplied by 100. 

- A pedigree is a family tree that indicates the phenotype of one trait being studied for every member of a family. It is use to determine how a particular trait is inherited. Females are circles and males are squares.

- During the development of a female within the embryo, one of the X chromsomes is deactivated in every body or somatic cell. This results in a genetic mosaic, some cells have one X deactivated with other cells having another X deactivated. The inactivated chromosomes condense into a dark spot of chromatic which is called the Barr body. 

- All female body cells have one Barr body. Normal male cells have none.

- Mutations are any changes in the genome. There are gene mutations and chromosome mutations. 

- Gene mutations are caused by a change in the DNA sequence. 

- Certain human genetic diseases can be caused by the inheritance of a single gene or by a chromosomal abnormality.

- Chromosome mutations can be seen under a microscope. It is done through a technique called karyotype. 

- Changes in chromosome number often result in humans with developmental limitations.

- Some chromosomal aberrations are: 

	- Deletion, when a fragment lacking a centromere is lost during cell division 
	
	- Inversion, when a chromosomal fragment reattaches to its original chromosome but in reverse direction. 
	
	- Translocation, when a fragment of a chromosome becomes attached to a nonhomologous chromosome. 
	
	- And polyploidy, when a cell or organism has extra sets of chromosomes. 

- Non disjunction is an error with meiosis where chromosomes dont seperate as they should. 

- One gamete may recieve two of the same type of chromosome and the other non at all. The remaining chromsomes may be normal. 

- When this abnormal gamete unites with a normal gamete during fertilization, the zygote will have an abnormal number of chromosomes. 

- An abnormal number of chromosomes is referred to as aneuploidy. 

- If a chromosome is present in triplicate, the condition is known as trisomy.

- Tristonomy 21 is when an extra chromosome 21 is there, this is down syndrome.
