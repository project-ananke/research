- Evolution is the change of allelic frequencies in a population. 

- Evolution can basically be thought of as the changing of species, we can see from fossil evidence that species that once existed no longer, and not all modern species date back too far. 

- We compare species to one another via anatomy, bio chemistry, and their embryotic development. 

- The molecular biology such as the specific amino acid sequences for respiration polypeptides, can be used to study relations as well. 

- Overpopulation and general competitiveness is thought to pick the strong from the weak for breeding, this idea is called natural selection and it was proposed by Charles Darwin. 

- There is stabalizing, disruptive, diversifying, directional, sexual, and artificial selections. 

- Stabilizing removes extremes, diversifying and disruptive. Directional is the replacement of gene pools. 

- Sexual selection is exactly as it sounds, it's basically online dating, choosing mates based off appealing characteristics. 

- Artificial selection is basically like breeding. 

- Variations in population can be caused by rare alleles becoming more prevelant, sexual reproduction procosses changing the DNA, and geography. 

- Some causes of evolution could be disasters changing the gene pool with mass death, natural selection, mutations, and specific mating. 

- Populations are non evolving and stable if they're large, isolated, have random mating, and have no mutations. 

- Divergent evolution is when an isolated population from the species developes into a new species. 

- Convergent evolution is when different species converge to the same pattern. 

- Parralel evolution is two species with a common ancesor having similar evolution. 

- Coevolution is animals evolving to eachother. 

- Evolutionary developmental biology is the study of how slight changes in genetics yield massively different results, like how humans and chimps are vastly different despite similar DNA.  How genes influence other genes, how they infleunce the development and location of body parts can account for these massive differences. 

- Most life on early Earth were basic prokaryotic cells that ate gases spewed by underwater volcanoes.
