- All cells descended from an ancestral cell. 

- The theory of endosymbiosis states that eukaryotic cells came into existence when the mitochondria and chloroplast merged with a larger cell. These orgnelles were thought to be prokaryotic cells at first. 

- Eukaryotic cells have internal membrane structures that compartmentalize functions. 

- Cell theory states that all living beings are made up of cells and that these cells emerged from pre existing cells. 

- The diameter of cells ranges from 10 to 100 micrometers ( 1 micrometer = 1E-6 meters). 

- All cells have barriers that protect them, this is called the plasma membrane, inside the cell is cryosol which is a semifluid substance that suspends organelles. 

- All cells contain RNA and DNA. 

- There are two types of cells, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells dont have a nucleus or internal membrane. Instead of a nucleus they have a nucleoid which is a region that has the DNA in the form of chromosomes. 


![[6.5.png]]


- Eukaryotic cells have compartmentalization and a nucleus bound by a double membrane. 

![[6.8.png]]

- Not all cells look a like, their appearance changes as their function changes. The human body has around 200 different types of cells. 

- There is a limit to cell size, the constraints are based upon the needs of the cell and the ability of the membrane to properly supply resources.  

- The nucleus of a non dividing cell contains a nucleolus, where rRNA (ribosomal RNA) is synthesized. This rRNA is a building block for ribosomes. 

- The ribosome is where protein is synthesized. It is not bound to any compartment so it just floats around, ribosomes that are attached to the rough ER typically produce proteins that are used for export, where as the free ribosomes are for the cells personal use. 

- Perixosomes are found within plant and animal cells, it contains catalase which converts hydrogen peroxide $(H_2O_2)$ into water with the release of oxygen atoms. I will note that hydrogen peroxide is a byproduct of cellular respiration, which will be discussed later. I will note that catalase is a type of enzyme

- DNA is organized into discrete units called chromosomes, these chromosomes carry genetic information. 

- The nucleus contains chromosomes wrapped with protein within a chromatin network. The complex of DNA and protein making up chromosomes is called chromatin. 

- The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear envelope, it is selectively permeable, it regulates what comes in and it seperate the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The envelope has pores which allow it to transport molecules like mRNA that would otherwise be too big to diffuse right through it. 

- The rough ER is *roughly* studded with ribosomes. 

- The smooth ER assists in the synthesis of steroid hormones such as sex hormones and other lipids. It also stores $Ca^{++}$ ions in muscle cells to facilitate normal muscle contractions. And it detoxifies drugs and poisons in the body. 

- The Golgi Apparatus is basically a warehouse where the products of the rough ER go. It is made up of flattened membranous sacs called cisternae. 

- The 2 sides of the GA are the cis face which recieves stuff from the ER, and a trans face which ships those materials. 

- The ER sends its products in transport vesicles to enter the cis face where it is processed and packaged into vesicles. The trans face then ships them out. A cell can have up to hundreds of Golgi stacks. 

![[6.12.png]]


- Cells have have programmed destruction called apoptosis. When this happens, a process called autophagy starts where hydrolytic (digestive) enzeymes wrapped in a membrane (these structures are called Lysosomes) come in and devour them. 

![[6.13.png]]


- The mitochondria is the power house of the cell. It is the main driving force for cellular respiration. Really active cells can have up to 2,500 of them. The have a double outer membrane and a series of inner membrane called cristae. The mitochondria contains its on DNA and in fact would often divide and fuse with other mitochondria to exchange DNA to account for defects. This is obviously support for the endosymbiotic theory. 

- Derived from the GA and ER is a storage structure called vacuoles, which are membrane bound. Many plant cells have a central vacuole which is quite large is just one of them. Fresh water protists (algae, amoebas and such) have contractile valcuoles which pump out excess water.  Food vacuoles are formed by the phagocytoisis (devouring) of foreign material. To learn more see figure 6.13. 

- Plants and algae get energy through photosynthesis. This process occurs in the cholorplast which contains a green pigment called chlorophyll. They have a double outer membrane and an inner membrane system called a thylakoid. 

- Chloroplasts have their own DNA which resembles bacteria DNA, prompting scientists to think that chloroplasts were once individual prokaryotic cells that later got engulfed. 

- The cytoskeleton is a mesh of protein filaments that are throughout the cytoplasm. Its functions are to maintain the cell's shape, control the position of organelles through membrane anchoring, cytoplasmic streaming (the flow of cytoplasm), and finally it holds the cell in place via extracellular interaction. 

- The cytoskeleton is made up of microtubules and microfilaments. 

- Microtubules are hollow tubes made up of tubulin which is a protein, it also makes up cilia, flagella, and spindle fibers.

- Cilia and flagella are responsible for moving the cell, they are made of 9 pairs of microtubules organized around 2 singlet microtubules. They are microtubule structures. 

- Spindle fibers help chromosomes seperate during mitosis and meiosis. It is made up of 9 triplets of microtubules. 

![[6.2.png]]


- Actin is a gobular protien, they make up microfilamets, they help support the shape of the cell. 

- Its functions are to form cleavage furrows (indentation in cell division). They allow ameba to move through pseudopods They also allow skeletal muscles to contract as they slide along myosin filaments. 

![[tubes.png]]


- Centrioles and centrosomes are microtubule organizing centers. They are nonmembranous stuctures, they exist outside the nuclear membrane. They organize spindle fibers are help create the spindle apparatus which is used in cell division. 

- The centrosome actually makes microtubules. 

- Plants and algae have cell walls made up of cellolse, fungi is made up of chitin, and other prokaryotes use polysaccharides and other polymers. 

- The primary cell wall is the first outside the plasma membrane, though some cells have a secondary cell wall underneath it. When plant cells divide a thin gleuy layer is formed between them which eventually becomes the middle lamella (it glues adjacent cells together). 

![[6.7.png]]


- The plasma membrane is selectively permable, it chooses what comes in and out of the cell, the most popular model for this strucutre is the fluid mosaic model. The eukaryotic cell membrane has a phospholipid bilayer with proteins dispersed throughout. 

- Hydrophobic molecules can easily dissolve in the lipid bilayer and pass right through. The same is not true for hydrophilic molecules. The interior of the membrane is hydrophobic so the movement of hydrophilic substances is impeded. 

- Integral proteins have non polar regions and span throughout the inerior of the membrane. 

- Peripheral proteins are loosely bound to the surface of the membrane. 

- Cholesterol molecules are embedded in the interior of the bilayer to stabalize it. 

- The membrane has the consistency of olive oil, 40 percent lipids and 60 percent water.

![[membrane.png]]


- I will list some of the functions of proteins within the plasma membrane: 		


-  TRANSPORT: Molecules, electrons, and ions are carried through channels, pumps, carriers, and electron transport chains, which manufacture ATP. 	  
 
 -  ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY: One membrane-bound enzyme is adenylate cyclase, which synthesizes cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. 	   

-  SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION: Binding sites on protein receptors fit chemical messengers (signaling molecule) like hormones. The protein changes shape and relays the message to the inside of the cell. 	  

 -  CELL-TO-CELL RECOGNITION: Some glycoproteins serve as identification flags that are recognized by other cells.   	  

 - CELL-TO-CELL ATTACHMENTS: Desmosomes, gap junctions, and tight junctions are examples. 	  	    

 - ATTACHMENT TO THE CYTOSKELETON AND EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX: This helps maintain cell shape and stabilizes the location of certain membrane proteins.


- Tranpsort is the movement in and out of the cell, it is either active or passive with active requiring ATP. 

- Passive transport is the movement down a concentration gradient until equilibrium is achieved. A concentration gradient can be thought of as a field of arrows pointing to where the concentration is highest, just like the idea of the gradient within mathematics. It moves down this gradient because of the thermal energy of the molecule, just think of it as the movement due to the increase of entropy or disorder within the system. 

- Diffusion and osmosis are both passive transport. 

- There is simple and facilitated diffusion, in which simple does not involve protein channels. (a transport protein which acts like a pore in the mebrane)

- Facilitated diffusion requires hydrophilic protein channels to allow it to move in. There are ion channels which function like gated channels which open and close in response to stimuli, and there are voltage gated channels. 

![[proteinChannel.png]]


- Among simple diffusion is countercurrent exchange which are two opposing fluids interacting to maximize simple diffusion, an example of this is the fish gills. 

- I will list some important words as an excerpt from a book. 

- DIFFUSION: random movement of molecules or other particles from a higher concentration to a lower concentration 

- OSMOSIS: the term used for a specific type of diffusion of water across a membrane SOLVENT: the substance that does the dissolving SOLUTE: the substance that dissolves 

- HYPERTONIC: having greater concentration of solute than another solution 

- HYPOTONIC: having lesser concentration of solute than another solution 

- ISOTONIC: two solutions containing equal concentration of solutes 

- OSMOTIC POTENTIAL: the tendency of water to move across a permeable membrane into a solution 

- WATER POTENTIAL: Scientists look at movement of water in terms of water potential. Water potential, symbolized by the Greek letter psi, ψ, results from two factors: solute concentration and pressure. The water potential for pure water is zero; the addition of solutes lowers water potential to a value less than zero. Therefore, the water potential inside a cell is a negative value. Water will move across a membrane from the solution with the higher water potential to the solution with the lower water potential.

- Since water moves in regards to solute concentration it can move into cells when they have a low water potential, this causes plant cells to swell and become crisp like the case of cellery. This is all from the turgid pressure, this pressure is held in through the cell walls. Dehydration causes a decrease of turgid pressure and so it wilts. 

- Aquaporins are found in some cells and facilitate the rate of the diffusion of water down its gradient. 

- Active transport moves molecules against the gradient and thus requires energy, usually ATP. 

- Pump or carriers carry particles across the membrane through active transport. 

- Sodium-potassium pumps pump $Na^+$ and $K^+$ across a nerve cell membrane returning to a resting base state. This is the major electrogenic pump. 

- Proton pumps are electrogenic pumps that generate a voltage to pump $H^+$ across the membrane. 

- Contransport are proton pumps that also pump another substance, for instance fructose within plants are also pumped against their gradient as they're next to the protons. 

- The contractile vacuole in freshwater Protista pumps out excess water that has diffused inward because the cell lives in a hypotonic environment.

- Exocytosis is when internal vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane in order to secrete macromolecules, an example of this are nuerotransmitters within nerve cells. 

- Endocytosis is when vesciles from the membrane that take in macromolecules. 

- Pinocytosis is cell drinking or the uptake of large dissolved particles. 

- Phagocytosis is when pseudopods wrap around smaller cells or particles and engulf them trapping them in membrane. 

- Receptor-mediated endocytosis enables a cell to take in large quantaties of specific substances. The ligand (molecule connected to the receptor) then causes endoxytosis to begin and the ligand gets engulfed and becomes a coated vesicle that enters the cell. Cells get cholesterol from blood this way. 

![[7.21.png]]

- Bulk flow is just fluid moving in the body, blood moves via the pressure from a pumping heart. Sap in trees moves from roots to trees via active transport of phloem. Bulk flow moves from a source to a sink 

- Cells communicate with chemicle signals. 

- Bacteria have a phenomenon called quorem sensing, this allows them to moniter and sense their population density through chemicle signaling, this how lets say symbiotic bacteria provide bioluminescence to a squid. The chemicle signals get dense enough that the amount of receptors sensing them sets off its own chemicle reaction. 

![[11.2.png]]


- Multicellular organisms have gap junction which permits the passage of material from one cytoplasms to another. The heart cells communicate ions to coordinate contractions. 

- Plasmodesmata are like gap junctions but for plants. 

![[11.4.png]]

- There are 3 types of local signalling in cells. Paracrine signaling where chemicle signals travel a short distance. Synaptic signaling, where the axon of a nerve cell releases neurotransmitters. And autocrine signaling where helper T cells release cytokines that signal themselves to release more cytokines. 

- The 3 stages to cell signaling are reception, transduction, and response. Reception is when a ligand binds to a recepton on the membrane or inside the cell. ***Transduction is when the signal is coverted to a form that can bring about a specific cellular response*** (important for future referance). Response is when a specific cellular response occurs, either by regulation of transcription or by cytoplasmic action. 

- On the surface, the membrane is covered with cell membrane receptors which bind to ligands. The receptors are actually in contact with the outside and the cytoplasm. The signal from the ligand is transmitted to the cytoplasm, then, it is carried by a second messenger, the most common of which is the cyclic AMP (cAMP). 30% of all human proteins are cell surface receptors. 

- The three types of cell surface receptors are ion channel receptors. G protein-coupled receptors, and protein kinase receptors. 

- Ion-channel receptors open and close gates to allow ions to flow in, they are the basis for normal nerve function. 

![[11.8_ion.png]]


- GPCR are cell surface proteins that work with G proteins which are like molecular switches. When ligands meet the receptor, they change the conformation of the cytoplasmic side which activates or turns on the G protein. When activated, it bonds to GTP which activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. This enzyme then converts ATP to cAMP, cAMP being the second messenger. 

![[11.8.png]]

- Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are plasma membrane receptors that have special enzymatic activity. The exist as stand alone units until a ligand binds with it, once this happens, the tyrosine kinase region activates which bonds to ATP. It therefore acts as tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that turns ATP into the amino acid tyrosine. 

![[RTK.png]]

- Hydrophobic messengers diffuse right throught the membrane and instead interact with intracellular receptors. They then catalzye a response in the cell. Some examples of these molecules are steroids, thyroid hormones, nitric oxide, and estrogen. Chemicles that mimick estrogen are found in plastics, for example the bisphenol A chemicle, this chemicle then passes into the cell and sets up an estrogen signal trasduction pathway which elicits a response from the cell. This can cause problems in fetal development, and thus the government puts microplasitcs inside our food. 

- When a cell gets a signal, it converts it into a cellular response, sometimes it is immediate, often times it occurs in multiple steps within a signal trasnduction pathway. It is a multistep pathway in which a small number of signal molecules produce a major cellular response. This is a cascade effect. This allows for signal applification. These pathways are in animal cells, plant cells, bacteria and yeast. Due to the similarities, it is suggested that all these cells emerged or evolved from a common ancestor. 

![[cascade.png]]

- This image above shows the cascade effect, it starts with one molecule and ends with many molecules of glucose being released into the blood stream. The ligand neednt even enter the cell, it just alters the receptor in some way and causes a domino effect of molecules activating. 



- The signals cause many reactions to occur. Some reactions are things like protein regulation, which comes from turning specific genes on or off. 

- Here is an excerpt from a book on 5 things to remember: 

1. They are characterized by a signal, a transduction, and a response. 

2. They are highly specific and regulated. 

3. One signal molecule can cause a cascade effect, releasing thousands of molecules inside a cell. 

4. They regulate cellular activity, altering gene expression, protein activity, or protein synthesis. 

5. These pathways evolved millions of years ago in a common ancestor.

- Cells have a planned death called apoptosis, once this happens, all its parts are chopped up, put into vesicles, and engulfed by scavenger cells. 

- Some reasons for this are embryotic cells no longer being needed such as a tadpoles tail, too much genetic damage like from radiation, and stopping infections like in plants. 

- In mammals, several different pathways involving enzymes called caspases carry out apoptosis. This can happen when they are triggered outside or inside or by the endoplasmic reticulum after too much protein misfolding.
