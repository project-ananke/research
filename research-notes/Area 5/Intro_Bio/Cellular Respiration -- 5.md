- Cellular respiration is how cells extract energy in the food they eat. Cells transfer that energy into ATP. ATP is instantly available for every cellular activity and so it is the main energy source. 

-  $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6 \cdot CO_2 \rightarrow 6 \cdot H_2O +$ Energy(ATP + heat). This is the equation of making ATP. 

- There are 2 types of cellular respiration, aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic has oxygen present anaerobic is oppsite. 

- Glycolysis (breakdown of glucose via enzymes) is followed by fermentation or lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation is the partial degradation of sugars or other organic fuel that occurs without the use of oxygen. 

- In Aerobic resperation, glycolysis is the first phase, it is then followed by the cytric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. 

- Reduction is the gain of electrons or hydrogen. Oxidation is the loss of electrons or protons. 

- In redox reactions, one substance is reduced while the other is oxidized. 

- When hydrogen with its electron is transferred from glucose to oxygen it goes down an energy level, this releases energy which drives the synthesis of ATP. 

- ATP is adenosine triphosphase, or an adenoside (nucleotide adenine plus ribose) plus 3 phosphates. Since the 3 phosphates are negative the ATP is an unstable molecule.

- Glycolysis is a ten step process that breaks down 1 molecule of glucose (6 carbon molecule) into 2 three carbon molecules of pyruvate or pyruvic acid and releases 4 molecules of ATP. It takes 2 ATP to start this process, so the net gain is 2. 

- Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and releases ATP without using oxygen. Each step is catalyzed by a different enzyme. This process releases 1/4 of the energy within glucose, the end product pyruvate is the raw material for the Krebs cycle which is the next step in aerobic respiration. 

- During glycolysis, ATP is produced by substrate level phosphorylation, by direct enzymatic transfer of a phosphate to ADP. 

- Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the third step, it is an allosteric enzyme. When the cell has enough ATP it inhibits glycolysis. When there is a lot of ATP PFK is inhibited.

- The mitochondrion is enclosed by a double membrane, the outer membrane is smooth, but the inner or cristae membrane is folded. The mitochondrion has 2 internal compartments, the other compartment and the matrix. The citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix. The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation take place in the cristaeo membrane.

- Aerobic respiration produces a lot of ATP, this process consists of an anaerobic phase glycolysis plus an aerobic phase. The aerobic phase has the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. 

- The citric acid cycle is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which is sometimes called the krebs cycle. It takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria, it required pyruvate which is the product of glyolysis. 

- The citric acid cycle completes the oxidation of glucose to $CO_2$, it turns twice for each glucose molecule that enter glycolysis. The cycle generates 1 ATP per turn by substrate level phosphorylation, the direct enzymatic transfer of phosphate to ADP. The remainder of the reaction is transfered to $NAD^+$ and FAD. The reduced coenzymes NADH and $FADH_2$ shuttle high energy electrons into electron transport chains in the cristae membrane.

- In the first step of the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) to produce citric acid. 

- The krebs cycle turns twice since glycolysis breaks down glucose to 2 pyruvate. 

- Before pyruvate enters the cell cycle, it must first combine with a vitamin called coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA. This conversion produces 2 molecules of NADH. 

- Each turn of the krebs cycle releases 3 NADH, 1 ATP, 1 FADH, and a waste product of $CO_2$ 

- During the krebs cycle, ATP is produced by the subtrate level phosphorylation, dirict enzymatic transfer of phosphate to ADP. 

- NAD and FAD are required for cell respiration. 

- $NAD^+$ and FAD are coenzymes that carry protons or elecrons from glycorlysis and the citric acid cycle to the electron trasport chain. 

- Without $NAD^+$ to accept protons and electrons, the cell would die. 

- NAD and FAD are vitamin derivatives

- The electron transport chain is a proton pump  in the mitochondria that couples 2 reactions, an exergonic and a endergonic one. It uses the energy from exergonic flow of electrons to pump protons against the gradient from the matrix to the outer compartment. This creates a proton gradient inside the mitochondrion. 

- The electron transport chain itself doesnt make any ATP but it sets the stage for ATP production during chemiosmosis.

- I will add in an excerpt from a textbook about the specifics of the electron transport chain: 

- The ETC is a collection of molecules embedded in the cristae membrane of the mitochondrion. 

- There are thousands of copies of the ETC in every mitochondrion due to the extensive folding of the cristae membrane. 

- The ETC carries electrons delivered by NADH and FADH2 from glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to oxygen, the final electron acceptor, through a series of redox reactions. In a redox reaction, one atom gains electrons or hydrogen (reduction), and one atom loses electrons or hydrogen (oxidation). 

- The highly electronegative oxygen pulls electrons through the electron transport chain. Electrons lose PE as they “fall down” the ETC toward oxygen. 

- NADH delivers its electrons to a higher energy level in the chain than does FADH2 . As a result, NADH provides more energy for ATP synthesis than does FADH2 . Theoretically, each NADH produces 3 ATP molecules, while each FADH2 produces 2 ATP molecules. 

- The ETC consists mostly of cytochromes. These are proteins structurally similar to hemoglobin. Cytochromes are present in all aerobes and are used to trace evolutionary relationships. 

- One component of the ETC is labeled Q, which stands for ubiquinone, or alternately coenzyme Q. The important thing about Q is that it is a mobile electron carrier. It diffuses within and along the membrane. If the cristae membrane were not fluid, Q could not move through it, and the ETC could not operate. This phenomenon is a great example of how the structure of a fluid membrane relates to its function. 

- Exergonic reactions are coupled with endergonic ones. The exergonic flow of electrons toward the highly electronegative oxygen provides the energy for the endergonic pumping of protons from the inner matrix to the outer compartment to create a gradient.

- This ends the excerpt 

- Most energy production comes from oxidative phosphorylation which converts ADP to ATP by oxidizing NADH and $FADH_2$. This energy-coupling mechanism is called chemiosmosis.  

- I will again add an excerpt of notes: 

- It is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain. 

- Protons are pumped from the matrix to the outer compartment, against a gradient, by the electron transport chain. 

- A proton gradient is created by a proton pump between the outer compartment and the inner matrix

- Protons cannot diffuse through the cristae membrane; they can flow only down the gradient into the matrix through ATP synthase channels. This process is chemiosmosis, the key to the production of ATP. As protons flow through the ATP synthase channels, they generate energy to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. This process is similar to how a hydroelectric plant converts the enormous potential energy of water flowing through a dam to turn turbines and generate electricity. 

- Oxygen is the final hydrogen acceptor, combining half an oxygen molecule with 2 electrons and 2 protons, thus forming water. This water is a waste product of cell respiration and is excreted.

Substrate level phosphorylation occurs when an enzyme, a kinase, transfers a phosphate from a substrate directly to ADP. Only a small amount of ATP is produced this way. This is the way energy is produced during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. (See Figure 6.1.)

Oxidative phosphorylation depends on chemiosmosis. This is the way 90 percent of all ATP is produced from cell respiration. During oxidative phosphorylation, NAD and FAD lose protons (become oxidized) to the electron transport chain, which pumps them to the outer compartment of the mitochondrion, creating a steep proton gradient. This electrochemical or proton gradient powers the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP during chemiosmosis. During respiration, most energy flows in this sequence: Glucose → NADre and FADre → electron transport chain → chemiosmosis → ATP Theoretically, about 36–38 ATP can be released from the aerobic respiration of 1 molecule of glucose. This is hypothetical because some cells are more efficient than others and cells vary in their efficiency at different times. Remember that during glycolysis, 2 pyruvates are formed and each enters the Krebs cycle separately. So following glycolysis, all numbers for FADH2 , NADH, and ATP are doubled. The catabolism (breakdown) of glucose under aerobic conditions occurs in three sequential pathways: glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the citric acid cycle, which produce the reduced coenzymes NADH and FADH2 . These coenzymes are then oxidized by the electron transport chain and ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation; see Figure 6.8.

- This ends the excerpt. 

- Fermentation can be used to create ATP without the use of oxgen, this process started when oxygen was scarce in the olden times. There are 2 types of fermentation alchohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. 

- Alcohol fermentation converts pyruvate into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. 

- Lactic acid fermentation is when pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid or lactate, this is how cheese is made, the skeletal muscles also do this when there is not enough oxyen, this causes burning and fatigue.
