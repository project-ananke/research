- **Matter** is made up of **Atoms**, which are made up of **electrons**, **protons**, and **nuetrons**. 

- The configuration of electrons determine the how the atom will react with other elements. 

- A ground state atom has all its electrons at the lowest available energy level. When an electron gains energy and moves to a higher energy level it is in an excited state. 

- Isotopes are atoms that vary only in the number of neutrons, too many cause it to be unstable, and will decay. The time it takes for half the mass to decay to a more stable isotope is called its half life. 

- Radiometric dating uses half life to determine the age of fossils. 

- Radioisotopes are radioactive isoptopes. It has uses such as radioactive iodine being used to diagnose and treat certain diseases.  

- Tracers are subtances that help identify, observe, and follow different chemicle procosses. 

- Chemicle bonds occur when two chemicles are attracted to the same electrons and they complete eachothers shell. 

- Ionic bonds are when the two bonding elements each lose or gain an electron, the losing atom becomes a cation (positive ion), and the gaining electron becomes an anion (negative ion). All an ion is a charged atom. 

- Some important ions are Na+, Ca+, and CI-. These are important for nerve function. 

- Covalent bonds are when atoms share electrons, the resulting structure is called a molecule. 

- Covalent bonds are the sharing of pairs of electrons, which are multiples of 2, these pairs are denoted by straight lines (--). For example, an "n" covalent bond is when 2 molecules shair n pairs or 2(n) electrons with eachother. 

- Equally shared electrons between two atoms resukts in a nonpolar bond. This bond is found in diatomic molecules such as H2, O2, etc. 

- Polar covalent bonds are when it is unequal. 

- Hydropholic means water loving, the opposite is hydrophobic. Polar molecules typically disolve in water. Water is called the "universal solvent."

- Since oxygen pulls on electrons harder than hydrogen, water is polarized meaning it has unequally charged regions. The polarization causes hydrogen to be attracted to the adjacent oxygen atoms and so hydrogen bonding occurs. This bonding is resposible for much of the properties of water. Since water is highly polar, it dissolves all polar and ionic substances.

- The specific heat of water allows it to resist temperature, which allows organisms to survive. 

- The hydrogen bonding within water causes it to have a surface tension, or a resistance to the bending of the surface. The surface tension is great enough that even insects can walk on water without breaking its surface. 

- The cohesion of water allows it to move up tree routes without expending much energy. This is referred to as transpirational-pull cohesion tension. The tugging from the evaporating molecules causes a net pull which moves water molecules upward. 

- Capillary action is what is generally defined as the movement of a substance with no external forces acting, water moving up trees is a good example of this. 

- When water solidifies into ice, it is not moving fast enough to break and reform hydrogen bonds, so it then bonds to 4 other water molecules, the distance between them is great enough to yield a less dense substance. 

- Ice floating allows for the insulation of the water beneath it, so sea creatures can survive during winter. When the ice melts it becomes denser and sinks, this causes water to circulate in the lake, this also brings oxygen from the surface back to the lake. Nutrients from bottom dwelling bacteria also returns to the top. The cycling of nutrients is called spring overturn. 

- pH is the meassure of acidity. pH =                    -log(H+). Acidity and alkalinity is just a meassurement of the amount of hydrogen ions within a liquid. The more H+, the more acidic and the lower the pH is. On the scale, 7 is neutral, 0 to 6 is acidic, and 8 to 14 is basic. 

![[3.11.png]]



- Most pH of living cells are 7. The slightest change in variation of pH can yield harmful effects, as it can affect how chemicle reactions occur. 

- Creatures regulate their pH with buffers, these are substances that resist changes in pH, they either absorb excess H+ or give it off. 

- The most important buffer within human blood is the bicarbonate ion. 

- Organic compounds are compounds (a joining of 2 or more elements) which contain carbon. These compounds are studied in organic chemistry. 

- Isomers are organic compounds with the same molecular formula but a variance in its structure. The three major variances are structural isomers. cis-trans isomers, and enantiomers. 

- Structural isomers differ in the arrangement of their atoms. 

![[4.7a.png]]


- Cis-trans isomers differ in their spacial arrangements around double bonds. These double bonds are not as flexible as single bonds. 

![[4.7b.png]]



- Enantiomers differ in that they are molecules that mirror eachother, like a right and left hand. The mirroring is important as different mirror images may produce vastly different results. 

![[4.7c.png]]

- There are four main classes of organic compounds, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. 

- Carbohydrates are used as fuel and building material. They are mostly composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 

- In carbs, the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is also 2 to 1. CnH2O is the general formula for carbohydrates. 

- The body uses carbs for quick energy. 

- There are 3 classes of carbohydrates, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharide. 

- Monosaccharides have a chemicle formula of $(CH_2O)_n$ , this being a 1:2:1 ratio. Glucose, galacose, fructose are examples of monosaccharides, they are also isomers of eachother.

- Disaccharides have the formula $C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}$. There are two monosaccharides that are joined together, one molecule of water was released in this process, this is called dehydration synethesis / condensation. 

![[5.2.png]]

- Hydrolysis is the opposite, it breaks down compounds by adding water. 

- When monosaccharides are joined together via dehydration synthesis, they produce polysaccharides. These polysaccharides are macromolecules, which are just big molecules. They are polymers of monosaccharides, a polymer being a long molecule consisting of many similar or identical building blocks linked by covalent bonds. Monomers are the building blocks of these polymers. 

- Some example of polysaccharides are storage and structural polysaccharides. 

- Structural: cellulose, which is the building block for plant cell walls, which enclose the plant cell.  Another is chitin, which makes is the building block used up to create exoskeletons for athropodes, they also are used as cell walls for mushroom interestingly enough. 

- Storage: Starch, it has two forms, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is unbranched, where as amylopectin is branched, with 1-6 linkages at each branch point. There is also glycogen, it is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle and is used as a quick source of glucose for energy, it is like amylopectin but with more branches. 

- Lipids are another class of organic compounds, they contain fats, oils, waxes, and steroids. Since they're all hydrophobic they are grouped together. Most fats consist of one glycerol and 3 fatty acids. 

- Carboxyl groups areÂ a combination of two functional groups attached to a single carbon atom, namely, hydroxyl (single-bonded OH) and carbonyl (double bonded O) groups


- A fatty acid is a hydrocarbon chain. There are saturated and unsaturated. 

- Fatty acids have long carbon skeletons, usually 16 or 18 carbon atoms in length. The carbon at one end is part of a carboxyl group. 

![[5.9.png]]


- Most saturated fats come from animals and are solid at room temperature. Butter is a saturated fat. These saturated fats contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. Since there is only 1 bond many hydrogens can bond to it and is this saturated with hydrogen. 

- Unsaturated fats have at least one double bond from the removal of hydrogen atoms, so they have less hydrogen, they're usually found in plants and are usually liquid at room temperature 

- Steroids are lipids with a unique structure, they have four fused carbon rings. Some steroids are cholesterol, testerone and estradiol. 

- Some functions are energy storage, one gram of any lipid will realese 9 calories per gram when burned in a calorimeter and produce twice the energy of 1 gram of carbohydrates or 1 gram of proteins.

- Structural: Phospholipids (a lipid in which a phosphate group replaces one fatty acid) are a major component of the cell membrane. One steroid, cholesterol, serves as an important component of the plasma membrane of animal cells.

- Endocrine: Some steroids are hormones. 

- Phospholipids consist of only 2 fatty acids at the glycerol backbone, this forms two hydrophobic tails. 

![[5.11.png]]



- The third hydroxyl group of the glycerol is attached to the phosphate group, which is charged and is hydrophilic. 

- The hydrophilic head of the phospholipid attracts water, in water, they actually assemble into something called a bi-layer. The hydrophilic phosphate is on the outside and the hydrophobic tails are on the inside.

- The phospholipid bilayer makes up the structural basis for all plasma membranes, which is the barrier of the cell. 

- Proteins are complex unbranches macromolecules that carry out many functions, such as growth and repair, cell signaling, regulation, enzeymatic activity, and movement. 

- Proteins are polymers or polypeptides which consist of amino acids, these amino acids are then joined by peptide bonds. Proteins are made up of 1 or several of these polypeptides. 

- Amino acids are made of a carboxyl group, an amine group, and a variable R, they're all attached to the central asymmetric carbon atom. 

![[amino.png]]


- R groups differ per amino acid, they are categorized by their chemicle properties such as being acidic hydrophonic, etc. The interactions of the R groups determine teh overall structure and function of the protein. 

- There are only 20 different amino acids yet many many different proteins. 

- Two amino acids connected by dehydration synthesis creats a dipeptide. They are connected via a peptide bond. 

- The protein shape and structure is what determines its function. There are 4 levels, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quanternary. 

- The primary structure is the unique linear sequence of amino acids. Any small variance in the sequence can lead to detrimental effects, one such examle is sickle cell disease. 

![[primary.png]]


- The secondary structure is from the result of hydrogen bonding within the polypeptide molecule. Polypeptide coils fold into two different shapes, alpha helix or a beta-pleated sheet. 


![[secondary.png]]


- Fibrous proteins are both an alpha and beta shape. 

- Wool, beaks, and reptile scales are made up of fibrous proteins. 

- Keratin, the protein within human hair is made up of alpha helixes. 

- Silk and spider webs are made up of beta-pleated sheets. 

- The tertiary strucutre is the 3d shape of the protein, it is super imposed on its secondary structure. The structure determines the specificity of the protein. This specificity determines which proteins it can and cant interact with. 

- Hydrogen bonding between R groups and amino acids, Ionic bonding between R groups, hydrophonic interactions, Van der Waals interactions, and disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids all contribute to the teriary structure. 

- Van der waals interactions are very weak interactions between electrically neutral molecules as they collide with or pass very close to eachother. 

- The quaternary structure refers to the structure of proteins consisting of multiple polypeptide chains. 

- The primary structure of proteins determines how it folds into its 3d shape. Other enviromental factors such as pH, salt concentration, and temperature can affect the folding. Conditions that change the shape adversly is called denaturing. Recall that a change in the protein structure causes a change in function. 

- The shape of a protein is called its conformation. 

- The intricacies of protein folding are still a mystery, however it was discovered that chaperone proteins or chaperonins assist in folding other proteins. 

- Misfolding can causes serious illnesses lie alzheimers and mad cow disease, the accumulation of these misfolded proteins in the brian are called prions. 

- Bioinformatics uses computers to analyze large sums of biological data. 

- X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy help reveal the conformation of proteins.

- There are 2 nucleic acids, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). They encode all hereditiary information. The DNA actually specifies how the amino sequneces in protein should be. 

- Nucleic acids are polymers, polynucleotides which are made up of nucleotides. 

- A nucleotide consists of a phosphate (P), a 5-carbon sugar âdeoxyribose or ribose, and a nitrogen baseâadenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or either thymine (T) (in DNA) or uracil (U) (in RNA).

![[5.23.png]]


- Functional groups are the components of organic molecules most involved in chemicle reactions. These groups are attached to carbon skeletons. 

- The difference between testerone and estradiol is just one group.
