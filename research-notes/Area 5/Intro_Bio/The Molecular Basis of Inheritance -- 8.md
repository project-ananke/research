- Bacterial transformation is when one bacteria shares its genetics with another in order to make it virulent. 

- Bacteriophages insert their DNA into bacteria in order to make progeny.

- DNA is a double helix shaped like a twisting ladder. It is a polymer consisting of repeating units of nucleotides. Within DNA, it is a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The four nitrogen bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Adenine and guanine are purines. Thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines. The nitrogenous bases are paired by hydrogen bonds, the adenine are bonded to the thymine by a double bond, and the cytosine to the guanine by a trible bond. 

- The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions.

- Both DNA and RNA exhibit base pairing rules that are conserved (unchanged) through evolutionary history.

- DNA combines with a bunch of proteins called histones, this forms chromatin. The double helix of DNA wraps around a core of histones forming nucleosomes. 

- RNA is a single stranded helix consisting of repeating nucleotides: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil (U). The 5 carbon sugar is called ribose.

- semiconservative replication is when DNA is copied identically. 

- The DNA first unzips itself and each strand serves as a template for the formation of new strands. 

- Replication begins at sites called origins of replication, where the two strands of DNA seperate to form replication bubbles. 

- At the end of each replication bubble is a replication form, a Y shaped region where the new strands of DNA elongate. 

- The enzyme DNA polymerase catalyzes the elongation of the new DNA strands. 

- DNA polymerase cannot initiate synthesis, it can only add nucleotides to the preexisting chain. This preexisting chain consists of RNA and is called a RNA primer. 


![[16.7.png]]

- DNA polymerase replicates the two original strands differently, one strand is formed toward the replication fork in an unbroken, linear fashion. This is called leading strand. The other strand forms in the direction away from the replication fork in a series of segments called Okazaki fragments, this is called the lagging strand. 

- Ozaki fragments are about 100-200 nucleotides long and are joined together by the enzyme DNA ligase. 

- Helicases are enzymes that untwist the double helix at the replication fork. The single stranded binding proteins act as scaffolding holding the 2 DNA strands apart. Topoisomerases lessen the tension on the slighlt wound helix by breaking and rejoining the DNA strands. 

- DNA polymerase carry out mismatch repair, in which they locate damaged regions. These damaged regions of DNA are then kicked out by the DNA nuclease. 

- Everytime DNA replicates, some nucleotides from the end are lost, to protect this, the body makes nonsense suequences called telomeres, they are created and maintained by the enzyme telomerase. Each time, telomerase get shorter, this causes the cell to age. 

- A triplet code is a specialized genetic code of 3 nucleotides often associated amino acid or protein synthesis. 

- Codon sequences code for specific amino acids.

- The process in which DNA makes protein is like this, first the triplet code in RNA is transcribed into a codon sequence in mRNA inside the nucleus. Next, this pre-RNA is processed or modified in the nucleus. Then, the codon sequence leaves the nucleus and is translated into an amino acid sequence (a polypeptide) in the cytoplasm of the ribosome.

- Transcription is the process of copying the information in a DNA sequence to a complementary RNA sequence. 

- When a sequence of DNA is expressed, one of the DNA strands gets copied inot mRNA. 

- rRNA is the building block of the ribosomes, it has one mRNA binding site and three tRNA binding site per ribosome. 

- tRNA (transfer RNA) carries amino acids from the cytoplasmic pool of amino acids to mRNA at the ribosome, it has one binding site for an amino acid and another for an anticodon sequence that bind the mRNA sequence. 

- There are three stages to transcription, initiation, elongation, and termination. 

![[17.8.png]]

- Initiation: It starts when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to DNA at the promoter region. The promoter tells the RNA polymerase where to begin transcription and which of the two cells to transcribe. A collection of proteins called transcription factors recognize the TATA box which is in the promoter, it then mediates the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA. A transcription initiation complex is the completed structure of transcription factors and RNA polymerase bound to the promoter. 

![[17.9.png]]

- Elongation of the strand happens as RNA polymerase add nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing chain.  RNA polymerase pries the two strands of DNA apart and attaches RNA nucleotides according to the base pairing rules, C with G and A with U. A transcription unit is the stretch of DNA that is transcribed into mRNA by the RBA polymerase following eachother in caravan style. RNA polymerase can read and detect damaged regions in mRNA too. mRNA errors are not as bad as DNA errors. 

![[17.10.png]]

- Termination continues elongation for a short distance after the RNA polymerase trasncribe the termination sequence (AAUAAA). Then, mRNA is cut free from the DNA template. 

- before the  pre-RNA strand is shipped from the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm, it is altered or processed by a series of enzymes. This is called RNA processing: 

- A 5' cap consisting of a modified guanine nucleotide is added to the 5' end. This cap helps the RNA strand bind to the ribosome in the cytoplasm during translation. 

- A poly (A) trail is added to the 3' end, this tail protects the RNA strand from degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. 

- Non coding regions of the the mRNA called introns or intervening sequences are removed or spliced out by snRNPs, which are small nuclear ribonucleicproteins within spliceosomes. This removal allows for exons which are expressed sequences to leave the nucleus. Because of this, the mRNA leaving the nucleus is shorter. 

- In alternative RNA splicing, different RNA segments are treated as exons and are treated as introns. Exons are expressed sequences, and introns are intervening, noncoding sequences. 

- Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory sequences within the primary transcript, they tell the cell to control their intron-exon choices. 

- Translation is the process in which codons (A, U, G, C) of an mRNA sequence are changed into an amino acid sequence. Amino acids in the cytoplasm are carried by tRNA to the codons of the mRNA strand of the ribosome according to the base pairing rules. One end of the tRNA molecule has a specific amino acid, the other end bears an anticodon ( The anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence found on tRNA that binds to the corresponding mRNA sequence.)

- tRNA is used repeatedly. GTP which is an energy molecule is used for this process. Each amino acid in the translation process is joined to the correct tRNA by a specific enzyme called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. 

- A codon, AUG, codes for the amino acid methionine and is also a start codon (first codon in the transcribed mRNA that undergoes translation). UAA, UGA, and UAG are stop codons meaning they terminate translation. Some tRNA have anticodons that can recognize two or more different codons. This occurs when the paring rules for the third base of a codon are not as strict as for the first two bases. This is called a wobble. 

- Translation has three stages, initiation, elongation, and termination. 

![[17.15.png]]

- Initiation begins when mRNA becomes attached to a subunit of the ribosome, AUG first as always. 

![[17.19INI.png]]


- Elongation continues as tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome and a polypeptide chain is formed. One mRNA molecule is generally translated simultaneously by several ribosomes in clusters called polyribosomes.

![[17.20.png]]

- Termination happens when a ribosome reaches one of the termination codons, a release factor then breaks the bonds between the tRNA and the last amino acid in the polypeptide chain.

- Mutations are permanent changes in the genetic material. They are mostly random and spontaneous. They are caused by mutagenic agents, like toxic chemicals and radiation. 

- Mutations in somatic cells disrupt normal cell function. Mutations in gametes can mess up the gene pool. Mutations are the raw material for natural selection.

- Point mutations are the most common, they're essentially a change in one base pair of a single gene. 

- Mutations that dont result in a cange in the amino acid sequence is called a silent mutation. 

- Insertion or deletion mutation are when a single nucleotide is inserted or deleted. This results in a frameshift as the entire reading frame is altered. 

- Viruses are parasites that use a host cell to replicate. Their structure is simpy DNA or RNA enclosed in a protein coat called a capsid. Some viruses also have a viral envelope that is derived from the membranes fo the host cell. Each virus can infect only one type of cell and only a range of species called a host range. 

- Bateriophages infect bacteria. The reproduce in the lytic cycle and in the lysogenic cycle. 

- The lytic cycle is when they take control of the cells machinery, replicate itself, then causes the cell to burst. 

- The lysogenic cycle, the virus incorporates itself with the host's DNA, it is called a prophage and remains dormant, it replicates as the cell replicates. It then switches to the lytic phase at some point. Viruses that can do both are called temperate viruses. 

- Viral replication can introduce genetic variation into its hosts.

- Retroviruses contrain RNA instead of DNA, the RNA serves as the template for the synthesis of complementary DNA, the flow of information from DNA to RNA is thus reversed. The reverse transriptase enzyme is in charge of reverse transcription. Retroviruses are usually permenant residents called prophages. 

- Transduction is when phage viruses acquire bits of bacterial DNA as they infect cells, causing a genetic recombination. There is generalized and restricted/specialized transduction. 

- Generalized transduction involves the transfer of random pieces of DNA. 

- Restricted transduction involves the transfer of specific pieces of DNA. 

- The reproductive cycles of viruses transfer genetic information via transposons and transduction

- Bacteria have double stranded DNA in their nuceloid region, their DNA replicates in both directions from a single point. They can either reproduce through conjugation which is like sex or reproduce asexually through binary fission. There is one mutation for every 1,000 replications. 

- In general, prokaryotes have circular chromosomes while eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes.

- Bacterial tranformation is the recombination of genetic information through extracellular DNA. 

- Plasmids are DNA molecules within bacteria that self replicate. the first one discovered was the F plasmid (fertility). F plasmid contains genes for producing pili, which are cytoplasmic bridges that connect to other cells to exchange DNA for conjugation. 

- R plasmids make the cell resistant to anti bacteria, this can be transferred during conjugation. 

- An operon is a set of genes and the switches that control said gene expression. There is repressible (tryptophan) operon, and inducible (lac) operon. 

- The tryptophan operon consists of a promoter and five adjacent structural genes that code for 5 seperate enzymes necessary to synthesize the amino acid tryptophan. 

- The lac operon is essentially the genes used to create enzymes for the intestinal bacteria within our body to break down lactose. 

- The CAP and cAMP proteins are responsible for the effecient breaking down of glucose and lactose when they're both present, switching between the different enzymes.

- RNA polymerase: Enzyme that transcribes a new RNA chain by linking ribonucleotides to nucleotides on a DNA template. 

- Operator: Sequence of nucleotides near the start of an operon to which the active repressor can attach. The binding of the repressor prevents RNA polymerase from attaching to the promoter and transcribing the operon’s genes. 

- Promoter: Nucleotide sequence in the DNA of a gene that is the binding site of RNA polymerase, positioning the RNA polymerase to begin to transcribe RNA at the appropriate position. 

- Repressor: Protein that inhibits gene transcription. In the operon of prokaryotes, repressors bind to the operator. 

- Regulator gene: Gene that codes for a repressor. It is located some distance from its operon and has its own promoter.

- Prions are misfolded proteins found in the brain, they are infectious and cause a lot of diseases. 

- The human genome is all of our collective genes, around 1% of it actually gets translated into proteins, the rest is just RNA basically, which can alter the expression of genes. 

- Short tandem repeats are units of 2-5 nucleotides, they vary from person to person and thus can be used to create a person's genetic or DNA profile. 

- The regulation of gene expression within eukaryotic cells is a lot more complicated than with prokaryotic cells. 

- Eukaryotic DNA is packaged with proteins called histones into chromatin, which is the building block of the nucleosome. Changes to histone affect the chromatin configuration, which can affect DNA transcription and expression. 

- Adding acetyl groups promotes the loosening  of that chromatin structure and permits transcription. 

- Adding or removing methyl groups to DNA can turn them off or on respectively. 

- Epigenetic inheritance is the alterations of genone that are dependant on the enviroment, these changes are not permanent like mutations. Epigenetics is not actually fully understood. 

- Alternative RNA splicing is a regulation of genes in which different mRNA molecules are produced from the same primary trancript. 

- The length of time for the degradation of mRNA after protein transcription is another factor for gene expression. The differences in time is how for example, bacteria are able to adapt to their enviroment so quickly. 

- 90% of non coding DNA is transcribed into noncoding RNA (ncRNA). They bind to and are assisted by special binding proteins called Argonaute proteins. 

- MicroRNA (miRNA) target specific mRNA molecules to either degrade them or block their translation. 

- Small interfering RNA (siRNA), they also block gene expression, it binds to mRNA before it can be translated. 

- Recombinant DNA means taking DNA from one or more sources and combining them into a molecule.

- There are different tools in biotechnology and genetic engineering, some techniques include Gel Electrophoresis, DNA probe, PCR, RFLPs, cDNA, and CRISPR.
