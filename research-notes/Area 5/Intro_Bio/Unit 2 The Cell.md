## Chapter 6 A Tour of the Cell: 

- Light microscopy and electron microscopy are important tools for studying cells. 

- All cells are bounded by a plasma membrane (seperates interior from outside enviroment) Prokayotic cells lack nuclei and other membrane enclosed organelles (small structures within the cell), while eukaryotic cells have internal membranes that compoermentalize cellular functions. 

- Plant and animal cells have most of the same organelles: a nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. Chloroplasts are present only in cells of photosynthetic eukaryotes.

- The eukayotics cells genetic information is stored in the nucleus and is carried out by the ribosomes. The nucleus houses chromosomes which are made of chromatin (DNA and proteins) it also contains nucleoli, were ribosome subunits are made. And also pores which regulate the entrance and exit of materials. The ribosomes main function is protein synethesis. I will note that chromosomes are what allows DNA to replicate correctly during cell division. 

- The endomembrane system regulates protein traffic and performs metabolic functions. Its functions consist of Smooth ER which is the synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, storage of calcium ions, detoxification of drugs and poisons. Its other function is Rough ER which is the synthesis of secretory and other proteins on bound ribosomes; adds carbohydrates to proteins to make glycoproteins; produces new membrane.  

- The Golgi apparatus' main function is the Modification of proteins, carbohydrates on proteins, and phospholipids; synthesis of many polysaccharides; sorting of Golgi products, which are then released in vesicles. 

- The Lysosomes function is the Breakdown of ingested substances, cell macromolecules, and damaged organelles for recycling

- The Vacuoles function is Digestion, storage, waste disposal, water balance, cell growth, and protection

- The way the cell actually gets energy is from the mitochondria and the chiroplast, which both change energy from one form to another. The mitochondrias main role is cellular respiration (breaking down molecules to get energy using oxygen), the chloroplasts main role is photosynthesis (present only in plants). The peroxisome's main function is that it Contains enzymes that transfer H atoms from substrates to oxygen, producing H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), which is converted to H2O

- The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that organizes structures and activities in the cell.  Microtubules are long, thin, tube-like structures that are found in the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. They are composed of protein subunits called tubulin, and they play important roles in cell structure and function. They shape the cell, guide organelle movement, and separate chromosomes in dividing cells. 

- Cilia and flagella are motile appendages containing microtubules. Primary cilia play sensory and signalling roles. 

- Microfilaments are thin rods that function in muscle contraction, amoeboid movement, cytoplasmic streaming (Cytoplasmic streaming is the movement of cytoplasm within a cell. It is an important process that allows cells to transport materials and organelles within the cell. Cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills a cell and surrounds the cell's organelles. It contains various proteins, enzymes, and other molecules that are important for cellular function.), and support of microvilli. Intermediate filaments support cell shape and fix organelles in place\

- Plant cell walls are made of cellulose fibers embedded in other polysaccharides and proteins.

-  Animal cells secrete glycoproteins and proteoglycans (Proteoglycans are a type of molecule that consists of a protein core with long chains of complex sugars attached to it. They help provide structure support and shape for tissue. )that form the extracellular matrix (ECM, The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of molecules that surrounds and supports cells in tissues. It is also important for tissue repair and regeneration, as cells can migrate into the ECM and use it as a scaffold to help them regenerate damaged tissue.), which functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation. 

- Cell junctions connect neighboring cells. Plants have plasmodesmata (Plasmodesmata (singular: plasmodesma) are small channels that traverse the cell walls of plant cells and allow for the direct communication and transport of materials between cells.) that pass through adjoining cell walls. Animal cells have tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. Junctions are cell-cell ahesion that allows for contact between cells. Desmosomes, also known as macula adherens, are cell-cell adhesions that provide strong mechanical connections between cells. They are found in tissues that undergo mechanical stress, such as the skin, heart, and muscles. Gap junctions are channels that allow for the direct communication and exchange of small molecules, ions, and electrical signals between cells. Tight junctions, also known as occluding junctions, are cell-cell adhesions that form a seal around the edges of cells, creating a barrier that prevents the passage of fluids and solutes between cells. They are found in epithelial tissues, such as the lining of the intestine, and play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of these tissues and in regulating the flow of substances across them.

- Mitochondrion are common to both plant and animal cells. 

- Cynanide binds to molecules involved in making ATP, most of the cynanide is the mitochondria as a result (this will be useful to know later)

- phagocytic white blood cells are the best for studying lysosomes. Since they are responsible for recycling and breaking down material, they'd naturally be in the phagocytic white blood cells asthey engulf and digest foreign material in the body. 


## Chapter 7 Membrane Structure and Function:

- The fluid mosaic model is a model that describes the structure and function of biological membranes, such as the plasma membrane of cells. It proposes that biological membranes are composed of a mosaic of proteins and lipids that are organized in a fluid, dynamic structure.

- According to the fluid mosaic model, the main component of a biological membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, which is a double layer of phospholipid molecules. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules, meaning that they have both hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) regions. The hydrophobic regions of the phospholipids are oriented towards the interior of the bilayer, while the hydrophilic regions are oriented towards the exterior. This arrangement helps to create a barrier that separates the inside of the cell from the outside environment and helps to maintain the integrity of the membrane.

- Amphipathic proteins are proteins that have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. They are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, with their hydrophobic regions interacting with the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer and their hydrophilic regions interacting with the hydrophilic exterior. Amphipathic proteins serve a variety of functions in the membrane, including structural support, signaling, transport, and enzyme activity. They are able to move within the membrane and can interact with each other and with other membrane components, contributing to the fluidity and dynamic nature of the membrane. 

- Phospholipids and some proteins move sideways within the membrane. The unsaturated hydrocarbon tails of some phospholipids keep membranes fluid at lower temperatures, while cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity caused by temperature changes. 

- Membrane proteins function in transport, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, cell-cell recognition, intercellular joining, and attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Short chains of sugars linked to proteins (in glycoproteins) and lipids (in glycolipids) on the exterior side of the plasma membrane interact with surface molecules of other cells.

- Membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the ER and modified in the ER and Golgi apparatus. The inside and outside faces of membranes differ in molecular composition.

- A cell must exchange molecules and ions with its surroundings, a process controlled by the selective permeability(discriminating on what is allowed into the cell. ) of the plasma membrane. Hydrophobic substances are soluble in lipids and pass through membranes rapidly, whereas polar molecules and ions generally require specific transport proteins.

-  Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its concentration gradient. Water diffuses out of a cell (osmosis) 

- The concentration gradient of a substance is the difference in concentration of the substance between two areas. When a substance is more concentrated in one area compared to another, there is a concentration gradient for that substance. Diffusion will occur down the concentration gradient, meaning that the substance will move from the area of high concentration to the area of low concentration.

- Water is a substance that readily diffuses through biological membranes. When water is placed on one side of a membrane, it will diffuse across the membrane and into the other side, if the concentration of water is higher on one side compared to the other. This process is called osmosis. Osmosis is important for maintaining the balance of water and solutes within cells and tissues and for regulating the volume and shape of cells

- Exocytosis is the process by which cells transport materials out of the cell and release them into the extracellular space. It involves the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane, which is the outer membrane that surrounds the cell. Transport vesicles are small, membrane-bound structures that carry materials such as proteins and lipids from one part of the cell to another. During exocytosis, the transport vesicle migrates to the plasma membrane and fuses with it, releasing its contents into the extracellular space. Exocytosis is important for various cellular processes, such as the secretion of hormones and other signaling molecules, the removal of waste products, and the release of enzymes.

- Endocytosis is the process by which cells take in materials from their environment. It involves the invagination of the plasma membrane, which forms small vesicles that pinch inward and enclose the material being endocytosed. There are several types of endocytosis, including:

 -   Phagocytosis: This type of endocytosis involves the engulfment of large particles, such as bacteria or cell debris, by cells that have the ability to phagocytose. Phagocytosis is carried out by specialized cells called phagocytes, which have extensions on their surface called pseudopodia that they use to surround and engulf the particles.
    
-   Pinocytosis: This type of endocytosis involves the uptake of small particles or droplets of fluid by cells. It is also known as "cell drinking" or "cellular pinocytosis."
    
-   Receptor-mediated endocytosis: This type of endocytosis is specific for certain types of molecules, such as hormones, growth factors, and nutrients. It involves the binding of the target molecule to a specific receptor protein on the cell surface, which initiates the endocytosis of the molecule and its transport into the cell. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a highly efficient and selective process that allows cells to take up specific molecules in response to signals from their environment.

- In facilitated diffusion, a transport protein speeds water or solute movement down its concentration gradient across a membrane. Ion channels facilitate the diffusion of ions across a membrane. Carrier proteins can undergo changes in shape that translocate bound solutes across the membrane.

- Ions can have both a concentration (chemical) gradient and an electrical gradient (voltage). These gradients combine in the electrochemical gradient, which determines the net direction of ionic diffusion

-  Cotransport of two solutes occurs when a membrane protein enables the “downhill” diffusion of one solute to drive the “uphill” transport of the other.

- Specific membrane proteins use energy, usually in the form of ATP, to do the work of active transport.

- Active transport is the process by which cells transport substances across the membrane against their concentration gradient, using energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). It is the opposite of passive transport, which is the movement of substances down their concentration gradient and does not require the input of energy.

- Active transport is important for various cellular processes, such as the uptake of nutrients, the maintenance of ion gradients, and the regulation of cell volume. It is also important for maintaining the balance of substances within cells and tissues and for allowing cells to take up specific substances in response to signals from their environment.

- Aquaporins are channel proteins that greatly increase the permeability of a membrane to water molecules, which are polar and therefore do not readily diffuse through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

- While the basic structure of the membranes of eukaryotic cells is similar, the proteins that are present in the membranes can vary depending on the function of the membrane. For example, the plasma membrane, which surrounds the cell, contains proteins that are involved in signaling, transport, and cell-cell adhesion. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, which are involved in the synthesis and modification of proteins and lipids, contain proteins that are involved in these processes. The mitochondria, which are involved in energy production, contain proteins that are involved in the production of ATP. Each membrane in a eukaryotic cell has a unique set of proteins that is specialized for its specific function.

- A greater proportion of unsaturated phospholipids would increase the membrane fluidity. 

- Passive transport includes osmosis, diffusion of a solute across a membrane, and the transportation of an ion down its electrochemical gradient. 

## Chapter 8 An Introduction to Metabolism: 

- Metabolism is the collection of chemical reactions that occur in an organism. Enzymes catalyze reactions in intersecting metabolic pathways, which may be catabolic (breaking down molecules, releasing energy) or anabolic (building molecules, consuming energy). Bioenerg

- Metabolic pathways are series of chemical reactions that occur within an organism to sustain life. These pathways allow cells to convert nutrients into energy and to synthesize the molecules necessary for cell growth and maintenance. Many metabolic pathways are interconnected and involve multiple enzymes, each of which catalyzes a specific reaction in the pathway.

- When two metabolic pathways intersect, it means that they share one or more reactions, and that the enzymes involved in those reactions can be used by both pathways. For example, the enzyme hexokinase is involved in the breakdown of glucose in the glycolysis pathway and in the synthesis of glycogen in the glycogen synthesis pathway. Because these two pathways intersect at this enzyme, the hexokinase can be used by both pathways to catalyze its specific reaction.

- Energy is the capacity to cause change; some forms of energy do work by moving matter. Kinetic energy is associated with motion and includes thermal energy associated with random motion of atoms or molecules. Heat is thermal energy in transfer from one object to another. Potential energy is related to the location or structure of matter and includes chemical energy possessed by a molecule due to its structure

- The first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. The second law of thermodynamics states that spontaneous processes, those requiring no outside input of energy, increase the entropy (molecular disorder) of the universe.

- A living system’s free energy is energy that can do work under cellular conditions. The change in free energy (DG) during a biological process is related directly to enthalpy change (DH) and to the change in entropy (DS): ∆G = ∆H - T∆S. Organisms live at the expense of free energy. A spontaneous process occurs with no energy input; during such a process, free energy decreases and the stability of a system increases. At maximum stability, the system is at equilibrium and can do no work.

- In an exergonic (spontaneous) chemical reaction, the products have less free energy than the reactants 1-∆G2. Endergonic (nonspontaneous) reactions require an input of energy 1+∆G2. The addition of starting materials and the removal of end products prevent metabolism from reaching equilibrium.

- ATP is the cell’s energy shuttle. Hydrolysis of its terminal phosphate yields ADP and ○P i and releases free energy.

- Through energy coupling, the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis drives endergonic reactions by transfer of a phosphate group to specific reactants, forming a phosphorylated intermediate that is more reactive. ATP hydrolysis (sometimes with protein phosphorylation) also causes changes in the shape and binding affinities of transport and motor proteins.

- Catabolic pathways drive regeneration of ATP from ADP + ○P i.

- In a chemical reaction, the energy necessary to break the bonds of the reactants is the activation energy, EA.

- Enzymes lower the EA barrier

- Each enzyme has a unique active site that binds one or more substrate(s), the reactants on which it acts. It then changes shape, binding the substrate(s) more tightly (induced fit).

- Each enzyme has a unique active site, which is a specific region on the enzyme that is involved in the chemical reaction. The active site has a specific shape and chemical properties that allow it to bind to one or more substrate molecules, which are the reactants that the enzyme acts upon.

- When the substrate molecules bind to the active site of the enzyme, the enzyme changes shape slightly, a process known as induced fit. This change in shape helps to bind the substrate molecules more tightly to the active site, which helps to bring them into the proper orientation for the chemical reaction to occur. The induced fit of the enzyme helps to ensure that the reaction occurs efficiently and correctly.

- The active site can lower an EA barrier by orienting substrates correctly, straining their bonds, providing a favorable microenvironment, or even covalently bonding with the substrate.

- Each enzyme has an optimal temperature and pH.

- Inhibitors reduce enzyme function. A competitive inhibitor binds to the active site, whereas a noncompetitive inhibitor binds to a different site on the enzyme.

- Natural selection, acting on organisms with variant enzymes, is responsible for the diversity of enzymes found in organisms

- Many enzymes are subject to allosteric regulation: Regulatory molecules, either activators or inhibitors, bind to specific regulatory sites, affecting the shape and function of the enzyme. In cooperativity, binding of one substrate molecule can stimulate binding or activity at other active sites. In feedback inhibition, the end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits the enzyme for a previous step in the pathway.

- Activators bind to allosteric sites on the enzyme and stimulate its activity, while inhibitors bind to allosteric sites and decrease the activity of the enzyme. Allosteric regulation allows cells to control the activity of enzymes in response to changing conditions or signals.

- Cooperativity refers to the phenomenon in which the binding of one substrate molecule to an enzyme can stimulate the binding or activity of other substrate molecules at other active sites on the enzyme. This can increase the overall rate of the reaction by making it more likely that all of the active sites on the enzyme will be occupied by substrate molecules.

- Feedback inhibition is a type of allosteric regulation in which the end product of a metabolic pathway allosterically inhibits the enzyme for a previous step in the pathway. This helps to prevent the pathway from continuing to operate when the end product has been produced in sufficient quantities, and helps to maintain homeostasis within the cell.

- Some enzymes are grouped into complexes, some are incorporated into membranes, and some are contained inside organelles, increasing the efficiency of metabolic processes.

- catabolism is to anabolism as excergonic is to endergonic. 

- Most cells cant use heat to perform work because temperature is uniform (entropy)

- Some Bacteria thrive in hot springs because their enzymes have high optimal temperatures. 

- If substrate and product are in equilibrium, then further enzyme would not cause anything.


## Chapter 9 Cellular Respiration and Fermentation:


- Cells break down glucose and other organic fuels to yield chemical energy in the form of ATP. Fermentation is a process that results in the partial degradation of glucose without the use of oxygen (O2). The process of cellular respiration is a more complete breakdown of glucose. In aerobic respiration, O2 is used as a reactant; in anaerobic respiration, other substances are used in place of O2.

- Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of living organisms. It involves the production of energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules. There are two main types of cellular respiration: aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen, and anaerobic respiration, which does not. Aerobic respiration is the most common and efficient type of cellular respiration and is used by most organisms to produce energy. During aerobic respiration, glucose and oxygen are consumed and carbon dioxide and water are produced as waste products. The energy produced during aerobic respiration is used by the cell to perform various functions, including the synthesis of biomolecules, the maintenance of membrane potentials, and the movement of molecules and organelles within the cell.

- The cell taps the energy stored in food molecules through redox reactions, in which one substance partially or totally shifts electrons to another. Oxidation is the total or partial loss of electrons, while reduction is the total or partial addition of electrons. During aerobic respiration, glucose (C6H12O6) is oxidized to CO2, and O2 is reduced to H2O 

- Electrons lose potential energy during their transfer from glucose or other organic compounds to O2. Electrons are usually passed first to NAD∙, reducing it to NADH, and are then passed from NADH to an electron transport chain, which conducts the electrons to O2 in energy-releasing steps. The energy that is released is used to make ATP.

- This statement describes the process of aerobic respiration, which occurs in the cells of most living organisms. During aerobic respiration, glucose and other organic compounds are broken down to release energy, which is used by the cell to perform various functions.

- The process begins with the breakdown of glucose, which releases energy stored in the chemical bonds of the molecule. This energy is then transferred to a molecule called NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which acts as an electron carrier. The transfer of electrons from glucose to NAD+ reduces the NAD+ to NADH (reduced form of NAD+), and releases energy in the process.

- The NADH is then passed on to an electron transport chain, which is a series of protein complexes that are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The electron transport chain conducts the electrons through a series of energy-releasing steps, in which the energy is used to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondria. This generates a proton gradient, which is used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate).

- ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, and is used to power a wide variety of cellular processes, including the synthesis of biomolecules, the maintenance of membrane potentials, and the movement of molecules and organelles within the cell.

- Glycolysis (“splitting of sugar”) is a series of reactions that breaks down glucose into two pyruvate molecules, which may go on to enter the citric acid cycle, and nets 2 ATP and 2 NADH per glucose molecule.

- Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytosol(The cytosol is the liquid component of the cytoplasm, which is the semirigid material that fills the cell and surrounds the cell's organelles.) of cells and is responsible for the breakdown of glucose to produce energy. During glycolysis, glucose is oxidized (loses electrons) and is converted into pyruvate, a three-carbon molecule. The process of oxidizing glucose releases energy, which is then used to synthesize ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of the cell.

- Glycolysis is an anaerobic process, meaning that it does not require oxygen.

- In eukaryotic cells, pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is oxidized to acetyl CoA (a 2 carbon molecule, the further oxidation releases energy), which is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle.

- The citric acid cycle is a series of enzymatic reactions that occur in the mitochondrion and involve the breakdown of acetyl CoA to produce energy. The energy produced during the citric acid cycle is used to synthesize ATP, which powers a wide variety of cellular processes.

- NADH and FADH2 transfer electrons to the electron transport chain. Electrons move down the chain, losing energy in several energy-releasing steps. Finally, electrons are passed to O2, reducing it to H2O.

- Along the electron transport chain, electron transfer causes protein complexes to move H+ from the mitochondrial matrix (in eukaryotes) to the intermembrane space, storing energy as a proton-motive force (H+ gradient). As H+ diffuses back into the matrix through ATP synthase, its passage drives the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP, called chemiosmosis.

- The synthesis of ATP is called chemiosmosis, and it occurs as the protons flow back across the inner membrane of the mitochondria through ATP synthase, a protein complex that uses the energy of the proton gradient to synthesize ATP.

- About 34% of the energy stored in a glucose molecule is transferred to ATP during cellular respiration, producing a maximum of about 32 ATP

- Glycolysis nets 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation, whether O2 is present or not. Under anaerobic conditions, anaerobic respiration or fermentation can take place. In anaerobic respiration, an electron transport chain is present with a final electron acceptor other than oxygen. In fermentation, the electrons from NADH are passed to pyruvate or a derivative of pyruvate, regenerating the NAD+ required to oxidize more glucose. Two common types of fermentation are alcohol fermentation and lactic acid fermentation

- Fermentation, anaerobic respiration, and aerobic respiration all use glycolysis to oxidize glucose, but they differ in their final electron acceptor and whether an electron transport chain is used (respiration) or not (fermentation). Respiration yields more ATP; aerobic respiration, with O2 as the final electron acceptor, yields about 16 times as much ATP as does fermentation.

- Glycolysis occurs in nearly all organisms and is thought to have evolved in ancient prokaryotes before there was O2 in the atmosphere.

- Catabolic pathways funnel electrons from many kinds of organic molecules into cellular respiration. Many carbohydrates can enter glycolysis, most often after conversion to glucose. Amino acids of proteins must be deaminated before being oxidized. The fatty acids of fats undergo beta oxidation(During beta-oxidation, fatty acids are broken down into two-carbon units called acetyl CoA) to two-carbon fragments and then enter the citric acid cycle as acetyl CoA. Anabolic pathways can use small molecules from food directly or build other substances using intermediates of glycolysis or the citric acid cycle.

- Cellular respiration is controlled by allosteric enzymes at key points in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

- During oxidative phosporylation(creating ATP), the main energy source for ATP synthesis is the H+ concentration gradient (flow of protons) across the membrane holding ATP synthase.

- This flow is driven by a proton gradient, which is generated as electrons are passed through the electron transport chain and used to pump protons across the inner membrane. As the protons flow back across the inner membrane through ATP synthase, their passage drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP.

- exergonic redox reaction(reduction of electrons reaction) provide the energy that establishes the proton gradient. The proton gradient itself is what fuels the ATP synthesis.

- When electrons flow along electron transport chains the pH of the matrix increases. 

- Most C02 from catabolism is released during the citric acid cycle. 

## Chapter 10 Photosynthesis: 

- Photosynthesis converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy stored in sugars.

- Autotrophs (“producers”) produce their organic molecules from CO2 and other inorganic raw materials; plants are photoautotrophs that use light energy to do this. Heterotrophs (consumers, including decomposers) are unable to make their own food and live on compounds produced by others.

- In plants and other eukaryotic autotrophs, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, organelles containing thylakoids. Stacks of thylakoids form grana

- Chloroplasts split water into hydrogen and oxygen, incorporating the electrons of hydrogen into sugar molecules. Photosynthesis is a redox process: H2O is oxidized, and CO2 is reduced. The light reactions in the thylakoid membranes split water, releasing O2, producing ATP, and forming NADPH. The Calvin cycle in the stroma forms sugar from CO2, using ATP for energy and NADPH for reducing power

- Light is a form of electromagnetic energy. The colors we see as visible light include those wavelengths that drive photosynthesis. A pigment absorbs light of specific wavelengths; chlorophyll a is the main photosynthetic pigment in plants. Other accessory pigments absorb different wavelengths of light and pass the energy on to chlorophyll a.

- A pigment goes from a ground state to an excited state when a photon of light boosts one of the pigment’s electrons to a higher-energy orbital. This excited state is unstable. Electrons from isolated pigments tend to fall back to the ground state, giving off heat and/or light

- A photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that funnel the energy of photons to the reaction-center complex. When a special pair of reaction-center chlorophyll a molecules absorbs energy, one of its electrons is boosted to a higher energy level and transferred to the primary electron acceptor. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex; photosystem I contains P700 molecules

- Linear electron flow during the light reactions uses both photosystems and produces NADPH, ATP, and oxygen

- Cyclic electron flow employs only one photosystem, producing ATP but no NADPH or O2

- During chemiosmosis in both mitochondria and chloroplasts, electron transport chains generate an H+ gradient across a membrane. ATP synthase uses this proton-motive force to make ATP.

- C4 plants minimize the cost of photorespiration by incorporating CO2 into four-carbon compounds in mesophyll cells. These compounds are exported to bundle-sheath cells, where they release carbon dioxide for use in the Calvin cycle

- CAM plants open their stomata at night, incorporating CO2 into organic acids, which are stored in mesophyll cells. During the day, the stomata close, and the CO2 is released from the organic acids for use in the Calvin cycle.

- Organic compounds produced by photosynthesis provide the energy and building material for Earth’s ecosystems.

- Bundle sheath cells are specialized cells that are found in the leaves of C4 plants, which are a group of plants that have evolved a specialized photosynthetic pathway to increase their efficiency in converting sunlight into chemical energy. Bundle sheath cells are responsible for the fixation of CO2 during the C4 pathway, and they are found in a layer around the veins of the leaves.

- In C4 plants, CO2 is fixed in bundle sheath cells by the enzyme PEP carboxylase, which converts CO2 into a four-carbon compound called oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is then converted into a three-carbon compound called pyruvate, which is used to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds. The synthesis of glucose in bundle sheath cells occurs through a process called the C4 pathway, which is more efficient than the process that occurs in C3 plants, which is called the Calvin cycle.

- On dry, hot days, C3 plants close their stomata, conserving water but keeping CO2 out and O2 in. Under these conditions, photorespiration can occur: Rubisco binds O2 instead of CO2, consuming ATP and releasing CO2 without producing ATP or carbohydrate. Photorespiration may be an evolutionary relic, and it may play a photoprotective role.

- The Calvin cycle, also known as the carbon reduction cycle or the Calvin-Benson cycle, is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert CO2 into glucose and other organic compounds. The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts, which are the organelles found in the cells of photosynthetic organisms.

- The Calvin cycle involves three stages: carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration. During carbon fixation, CO2 is captured by the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and is converted into a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). 3-PGA is then reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a compound that can be used to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds.

- The reduction stage of the Calvin cycle involves the transfer of electrons from NADPH (reduced form of NADP+), a molecule produced during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, to G3P, which is converted into glucose and other organic compounds. The regeneration stage involves the regeneration of RuBisCO, which is used to capture more CO2 and continue the cycle.

## Chapter 11 Cell Communication: 

- Signal transduction pathways are crucial for many processes. Bacterial cells can sense the local density of bacterial cells (quorum sensing). Signaling during yeast cell mating has much in common with processes in multicellular organisms, suggesting an early evolutionary origin of signaling mechanisms.

- Local signaling by animal cells involves direct contact or the secretion of local regulators. For long-distance signaling, animal and plant cells use hormones; animals also pass signals electrically

- Like epinephrine, other hormones that bind to membrane receptors trigger a three-stage cell-signaling pathway

- The binding between signaling molecule (ligand) and receptor is highly specific. A specific shape change in a receptor is often the initial transduction of the signal.

- Three of the major types of cell-surface transmembrane receptors are the following: (1) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) work with cytoplasmic G proteins. Ligand binding activates the receptor, which then activates a specific G protein, which activates yet another protein, thus propagating the signal. (2) Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) react to the binding of signaling molecules by forming dimers and then adding phosphate groups to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic part of the other monomer making up the dimer. Relay proteins in the cell can then be activated by binding to different phosphorylated tyrosines, allowing this receptor to trigger several pathways at once. (3) Ligand-gated ion channels open or close in response to binding by specific signaling molecules, regulating the flow of specific ions across the membrane.

- This statement describes three types of cell-surface transmembrane receptors, which are proteins that are found on the surface of cells and play a role in the detection of signaling molecules. These receptors are important in the communication between cells, as they allow cells to respond to signals from their environment and coordinate their activities with other cells.

-   G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins that work with cytoplasmic G proteins. When a signaling molecule (ligand) binds to a GPCR, it activates the receptor, which then activates a specific G protein. The activated G protein activates another protein, which can then trigger a variety of cellular responses, including the activation of enzymes, the opening or closing of ion channels, and the release of hormones and neurotransmitters.

-   Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins that react to the binding of signaling molecules by forming dimers and then adding phosphate groups to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic part of the other monomer making up the dimer. This process activates relay proteins in the cell, which can bind to different phosphorylated tyrosines and trigger several pathways at once. RTKs are important in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

-   Ligand-gated ion channels are transmembrane proteins that open or close in response to the binding of specific signaling molecules, regulating the flow of specific ions across the membrane. Ligand-gated ion channels are important in the regulation of various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, and nerve impulse conduction. 

- The activity of all three types of receptors is crucial; abnormal GPCRs and RTKs are associated with many human diseases.

- Intracellular receptors are cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins. Signaling molecules that are hydrophobic or small enough to cross the plasma membrane bind to these receptors inside the cell.

- At each step in a signal transduction pathway, the signal is transduced into a different form, which commonly involves a shape change in a protein. Many signal transduction pathways include phosphorylation cascades, in which a series of protein kinases each add a phosphate group to the next one in line, activating it. Enzymes called protein phosphatases remove the phosphate groups. The balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulates the activity of proteins involved in the sequential steps of a signal transduction pathway. 

- Phosphorylation cascades are signaling pathways that involve the sequential transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to specific proteins. Phosphorylation is the process by which a phosphate group is added to a protein, and it can regulate the activity of the protein by activating or inhibiting its function

- In a phosphorylation cascade, a signaling molecule (ligand) binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell, activating the receptor and causing it to phosphorylate a specific protein. The phosphorylated protein then acts as a second messenger, activating another protein, which can then phosphorylate yet another protein, and so on. This process continues until the signal is terminated or the final target protein is activated.

- Protein kinases are enzymes that add phosphate groups to proteins. Protein kinases catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a protein, a process called protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism by which cells regulate the activity of proteins and coordinate their activities with other proteins.

- Second messengers, such as the small molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the ion Ca2 + , diffuse readily through the cytosol and thus help broadcast signals quickly. Many G proteins activate adenylyl cyclase, which makes cAMP from ATP. Cells use Ca2 + as a second messenger in GPCR and RTK pathways. The tyrosine kinase pathways can also involve two other second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 can trigger a subsequent increase in Ca2 + level.

- Some pathways lead to a nuclear response: Specific genes are turned on or off by activated transcription factors. In others, the response involves cytoplasmic regulation.

-  Cellular responses are not simply on or off; they are regulated at many steps. Each protein in a signaling pathway amplifies the signal by activating multiple copies of the next component; for long pathways, the total amplification may be over a millionfold. The combination of proteins in a cell confers specificity in the signals it detects and the responses it carries out. Scaffolding proteins increase signaling efficiency. Pathway branching further helps the cell coordinate signals and responses. Signal response can be terminated quickly because ligand binding is reversible.

- Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death in which cell components are disposed of in an orderly fashion. Studies of the soil worm Caenorhabditis elegans clarified molecular details of the relevant signaling pathways. A death signal leads to activation of caspases and nucleases, the main enzymes involved in apoptosis.

- Several apoptotic signaling pathways with related proteins exist in the cells of humans and other mammals, triggered in different ways. Signals eliciting apoptosis can originate from outside or inside the cell.

- The binding of a signaling molecule to a ligand-gated ion channel leads directly to a change in the distribution of substances on opposite sides of the membrane. This statement refers to the role of ligand-gated ion channels in the regulation of the flow of ions across the membrane of cells. Ligand-gated ion channels are transmembrane proteins that open or close in response to the binding of specific signaling molecules, called ligands.

- When a ligand binds to a ligand-gated ion channel, it causes the channel to open or close, allowing ions to flow across the membrane. The movement of ions across the membrane leads to a change in the distribution of substances on opposite sides of the membrane.

-  Ligand-gated ion channels are important in the regulation of various physiological processes, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse conduction, and hormone secretion. They play a crucial role in the communication between cells, as they allow cells to respond to signals from their environment and coordinate their activities with other cells

- Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins that are activated by the binding of signaling molecules, called ligands. When a ligand binds to an RTK, it causes the receptor to dimerize (form a dimer) and undergo phosphorylation (the addition of a phosphate group). The dimerization and phosphorylation of RTKs activates relay proteins in the cell, which can bind to different phosphorylated tyrosines and trigger several pathways at once. RTKs are important in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

- Lipid-soluble signaling molecules, such as aldosterone, can cross the membranes of all cells because they are able to dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane. However, these signaling molecules only affect target cells because they bind to intracellular receptors that are present only in those cells.

- Intracellular receptors are proteins that are found inside the cell, and they play a role in the detection of signaling molecules that are able to cross the membrane. When a signaling molecule binds to an intracellular receptor, it activates the receptor, which can then trigger a variety of cellular responses, including the activation of enzymes, the opening or closing of ion channels, and the release of hormones and neurotransmitters.

- Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. It involves the orderly degradation and removal of cells that are no longer needed or that are damaged or infected. During apoptosis, the DNA of the cell is fragmented into small pieces, which are then packaged into small, membrane-bound vesicles called apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic bodies are then recognized and engulfed by phagocytic cells, which remove the cells from the body.

## Chapter 12 The Cell Cycle: 

- Unicellular organisms reproduce by cell division; multicellular organisms depend on cell division for their development from a fertilized egg and for growth and repair.

- The genetic material (DNA) of a cell—its genome—is partitioned among chromosomes. Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of one DNA molecule associated with many proteins. Together, the complex of DNA and associated proteins is called chromatin. The chromatin of a chromosome exists in different states of condensation at different times. In animals, gametes have one set of chromosomes and somatic cells have two sets.

- Cells replicate their genetic material before they divide, each daughter cell receiving a copy of the DNA. Prior to cell division, chromosomes are duplicated. Each one then consists of two identical sister chromatids joined along their lengths by sister chromatid cohesion and held most tightly together at a constricted region at the centromeres. When this cohesion is broken, the chromatids separate during cell division, becoming the chromosomes of the daughter cells. Eukaryotic cell division consists of mitosis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm).

-  Sister chromatids are two identical copies of a chromosome that are joined together at the centromere. Sister chromatids are formed during the process of DNA replication, in which the DNA molecule is replicated to produce two identical copies of the chromosome. Sister chromatids are held together by cohesin proteins, which allow them to remain connected until they are separated during the process of mitosis.

- A centromere is a region of DNA on a chromosome that is essential for the proper segregation of the chromosome during cell division. The centromere is the point where the two sister chromatids, which are identical copies of the chromosome, are joined together.

-  Cell division is part of the cell cycle, an ordered sequence of events in the life of a cell

- Between divisions, a cell is in interphase: the G1, S, and G2 phases. The cell grows throughout interphase, with DNA being replicated during the synthesis (S) phase. Mitosis and cytokinesis make up the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle.

- All the cell cycle is, is a series of events that occur in a cell as it grows and divides. Interphase and mitosis phase are the 2 main phases. 

- During interphase, the cell grows and carries out its normal functions, and DNA is replicated in preparation for cell division. Interphase is further divided into three phases: G1, S, and G2.

-   G1 phase: This is the first phase of interphase, and it is characterized by cell growth and the synthesis of proteins and other cellular components.

-  S phase: During this phase, DNA replication occurs. The DNA molecule is replicated to produce two identical copies of the chromosome, called sister chromatids.

-    G2 phase: This is the final phase of interphase, and it is characterized by the synthesis of proteins and the preparation of the cell for division.

-  The mitotic phase, also known as the M phase, is the phase of the cell cycle during which mitosis and cytokinesis occur. Mitosis is the process by which the nucleus of a cell divides into two daughter nuclei, each containing an identical copy of the genetic material. Cytokinesis is the process by which the cytoplasm of the cell is divided into two daughter cells.

- The mitotic spindle, made up of microtubules, controls chromosome movement during mitosis. In animal cells, it arises from the centrosomes and includes spindle microtubules and asters. Some spindle microtubules attach to the kinetochores of chromosomes and move the chromosomes to the metaphase plate. After sister chromatids separate, motor proteins move them along kinetochore microtubules toward opposite ends of the cell. The cell elongates when motor proteins push nonkinetochore microtubules from opposite poles away from each other.

-  Mitosis is usually followed by cytokinesis (Cytoplasms divides). Animal cells carry out cytokinesis by cleavage, and plant cells form a cell plate.

- In animal cells, cytokinesis is usually carried out by cleavage, which involves the formation of a contractile ring around the equator of the cell. The contractile ring consists of actin and myosin filaments, which contract and squeeze the cytoplasm of the cell, dividing it into two daughter cells.

- In plant cells, cytokinesis is usually carried out by the formation of a cell plate, which is a structure that divides the cell into two daughter cells. The cell plate forms in the center of the cell and grows outward, eventually dividing the cell into two daughter cells.

- During binary fission in bacteria, the chromosome replicates and the daughter chromosomes actively move apart. Some of the proteins involved in bacterial binary fission are related to eukaryotic actin and tubulin.

- Since prokaryotes preceded eukaryotes by more than a billion years, it is likely that mitosis evolved from prokaryotic cell division. Certain unicellular eukaryotes exhibit mechanisms of cell division that may be similar to those of ancestors of existing eukaryotes. Such mechanisms might represent intermediate steps in the evolution of mitosis

- Signaling molecules present in the cytoplasm regulate progress through the cell cycle.

-  In the cell cycle control system, cyclic changes in regulatory proteins—including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)—work as a cell cycle clock. The cell cycle stops at specific checkpoints until a go-ahead signal is received; important checkpoints occur in G1, G2, and M phases. Internal and external signals control the cell cycle checkpoints via signal transduction pathways. Most cells exhibit density-dependent inhibition of cell division as well as anchorage dependence

- Cancer cells elude normal cell cycle regulation and divide unchecked, forming tumors. Malignant tumors invade nearby tissues and can undergo metastasis, exporting cancer cells to other sites, where they may form secondary tumors.

-  Malignant tumors are cancerous tumors that have the ability to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. This process, called metastasis, occurs when cancer cells break away from the primary tumor and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system. The cancer cells can then be carried to other parts of the body, where they can form secondary tumors.

- Mitosis occuring without cytokineses will result in cells having more than one nucleus.
