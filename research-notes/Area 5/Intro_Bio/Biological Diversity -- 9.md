- Taxomomy is the classification of species. It uses the system of binomial nomenclature, which basically means that every species has a 2 part name and has a hierarchical structure. 

- The groups or taxa of species from general to specific are kingdoms, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. 

- The three domain classification system refers to all species belonging to either the eukarya, bacteria, or archaea domains. 

- Bacteria are usually harmful, are single celled organisms that reproduce asexually, although some can reproduce through conjuction which is like sex, they serve important roles as decomposers, are used in genetic engineering, and have countless other applications. 

- Archaea are unicellular (one cell), they dont have any internal membranes such as a nucleus, and they mostly live in extreme conditions. 

- Eukarya are just multicellular organisms with internal membrane structures. 

- Most complex animals are tripoblastic, meaning they have the ectoderm (skin and nerve cells and neurons), endoderm (guts), and mesoderm (blood and bones)

- Some primitive animals only have a ectoderm and endoderm with a glue layer called the mesoglea connecting them. 

- Phylogenetic trees are ways to structure the genetic history of animals as their evolution.
