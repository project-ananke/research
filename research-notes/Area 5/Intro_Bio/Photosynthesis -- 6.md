- Photosynthesis is the process that converts the energy from light into chemical energy. 

- $6 \cdot CO_2 + 12 \cdot H_2O +$ Light energy $\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6 \cdot O_2 + 6 \cdot H_2O$ This is the general equation for photosynthesis. It is a reduction reaction. 

- There are light-dependant and light-independant reactions within photosynthesis, the light dependant uses light to make ATP, the independant uses said ATP to make sugar. The sugar making is done in the Calvin cycle.  

- The photosynthetic pigments absorb the light energy, the 2 major pigments are chlorophyll and carotendoid. Chlorophyll a and b absorb all non green wavelengths. Carotenoid are yellow, orange, and red, they absorb blue, green, and violet. Xantophyll is another pigmentation with a slight variation from carotenoid. 

- The phycoblin pigment found in red algae absorbs blue and green light and reflects red. 

- Chlorophyll b, the carotenoids, and the phylcoblins are called atenna pigments. 

- Chlorophyll a is the most prominent pigment. The head of the molecule attached to the hydrocarbon tail is the source of electrons that flow through the electron transport chain. 

- The chloroplast contrains the pigments and enzymes that help with photosynthesis. It contains the grana where light dependant reactions occur, and the stroma where the light independant reactions occur.

- Thylakoids are the layers of membrane on the grana. 

- Photosystems are located within the thylakoid, their function is to harvest light. There are reaction centers within the photosytem which contrains chlorophyll a and a region with severeal hundred atenna pigments. 

- The two photsystems are PS I and PS II. PS 1 absorbs 700nm range so it is called P700. PS II absorbs 680nm range so it is called P680.

- The two possible routes for electron flow are noncyclic flow and cyclic photophosphorylation. 

- In noncylic photophosphorylation, electrons enter 2 transport chains, the products are ATP and NADHP. The process begins in the P680

- Electrons flow from water to P680 to P700 to NADP, which carries them to the calvin cycle. 

- First, energy is absorbed by P680, electrons from the double bonds in the head get excited and move to a higher energy level, they are then captured by a primary electron acceptor. 

- Phrotolysis is splitting water to provide electrons to replace the ones lost from chlorophyll a in P680. $H_2O \rightarrow + 2e^- + O_2 \uparrow$

- Electrons from the P680 pass along the electron transport chain which contains cytochromes and several other proteins, it ends up in the P700. The flow of electrons is exergonic and provides the energy needed to produce ATP in a process called photophosphorylation. 

- Chemiosmosis is when the protons released from water are pumped by the thylakoid membrane from the stroma into the thylakoid space (lumen), as the protons diffuse down the gradient, through the ATP synthase channels and into the stroma, ATP is produced. This is how the plants make the ATP. 

- NADP gets 2 protons in the P680 from water, the formed NADPH then carries hydrogen to the calvin cycle to make sugar in the light dependant reactions.

- The cyclic photophosphorylation produces ATP without NADPH or oxygen. 

- The sugar production for the Calvic cycle required ATP so sometimes the plant runs out, when that happens, cyclic photophosphorylation happens.

- The Calvin cycle is a cyclic process for the light independant reactions. It produces a 3 carbon sugar called PGAL. 

- The process that occurs in the Calvin cycle is called carbon fixation 

- Carbon gains protons and electrons so it is a reduction reaction 

- $CO_2$ enters and attaches to a 5 carbon sugar molecule called RuBP which forms a 6 carbon molecule. It is unstable and breaks down into 2 3 carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglycerate. (3-PGA G3P). ribulose biphosphate carboxylase or rubisco is what catalyzes the first step. 

- The initial molecules needed are ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle. 

- The Calvin cycle occurs only in light.

- In most plants $CO_2$ is fixed into 3-PGA by the enzyme rubisco. These plants are called C-3 plants. Rubisco can also bind to $O_2$, when this happens, photorespiration diverts the process. No ATP is produced, and no sugar is formed. 

- What happens instead is that peroxisomes break down the products of photorespiration. It is possible this occurs because ancient earth had little to no free oxygen. 

- C-4 photosynthesis occurs in hotter enviroments, this process minimizes water loss whilst maximizing sugar production.
