- Metabolism is the general term used for thousands and thousands of chemical reactions occuring in all living things. 

- Metabolism is broken down into anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism is the overall process by which cells synthesize molecules and strucutures. It requires an input of energy. Catabolism is the overall chemical process in which cells break down large molecules into smaller ones. 

- Metabolism allows for synthesis reactions, and for life in general. 

- Chemical reactions within metabolism are catalyzed through enzymes. Enzymes are just biological catalysts. 

- Enzymes reduce the amount of activation energy, or the energy needed to start a reaction in the first place. 

- The reactants within the enzyme are known as substrates, the produces are end products. 

- Enzymes are highly specific, specific enzymes exist for specific chemical reactions. 

- The cofactors of an enzyme can be organic like NAD and FAD, or inorgnaic like iron and other elements. 

- Enzymes work by binding substrates to active sites in order to cause reactions. 

- Enzymes are proteins and are thus susceptible to the enviroment. 

- Most reactions within metabolism are types of anabolism, plus catabolism still needs an input of energy, so energy is very important. 

- Energy is stored in ATP, when it is broken down whats left is ADP. 

- The energy in ATP is stored in the chemical bonds that unite phospate groups to the ADP molecule. 

- ATP doesnt last more than a few minutes, the end result of phosphate groups and ADP are recycled and turned into ATP again. 

- Energy is released within oxidation reactions where electrons are lost from the substrate molecules, and in reduction reactions, where electrons are added to a substrate molecule. The energy released is captured in ATP. 

- For photosynthesis, the energy from photosynthesis is stored into carbohydrate molecules, the breaking down of these molecules releases energy which is captured in ATP. 

- Carbs are used as energy sources for metabolic pathways, it is a series of reactions, usually the products for one is used as substrates for the next reaction. Each reaction is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Some metabolic pathways branch out like trees or are like cycles. The reactions of metabolism are usually interconnected and often merge at many points. The effect of metabolism is to integrate many reactions for the benefit of the cell. ***Idea: Incorporate this into a model*** 

- Glycolysis is a common pathway, it is the breakdown of sugar. It is the process of converting a glucose molecule to a whole bunch of different molecules down the pathway, you started with a 6 carbon molecule and end with a 3 carbon molecule called a pyruvate. 

- ATP is used for some of the processes within glyolysis, so there is an energy investment, it pays off though as you get more than you put in. 

- At one point in glyolysis, a oxidation-reduction reaction takes place, where a pair of electrons are transferred from a 3 carbon molecule to NAD, this reduces it and thus needs a hydrogen ion, so it becomes NADH. This happens twice for each 3 carbon intermediate molecule. 

- Glycolysis yields 2 pyruvate, this is later used in the citric acid cycle.

- When oxygen is not involved in the metabolic pathway, you could get some interesting end products from pyruvate like alcohol, you can then use this to get drunk. 

- Fermentation ^^ can only occur when there is no oxygen.

- The citric acid cycle is cyclical, its end products are the starting products. 

- Pyruvate is reduced to a 2 carbon molecule via an enzyme, the remaining part then unites with a coenzyme called coenzyme A, the result is 2 molecules called acetyl CoA. This reaction also frees up electrons which creates NADH, so there are now 4 NADH molecules available for electron transport. 

- The citric acid cycle combines acetyl CoA with a 4 carbon molecule called oxaloactic acid. This forms the 6 carbon molecule called citric acid. This is then converted to a 5 carbon molecule whith the other carbon atom becoming Co2. The remaining molecule loses another carbon atom, and so more Co2 is released. This is why animals produce Co2 as a waste product. 

- The reactions of the citric acid cycle continue, ending with oxaloacetic acid, which then unites with acetyl CoA and turns the cycle again. 

- The citric acid cycle is important as it provides a lot of free electrons, both in the form of NADH and $FADH_2$, which is a reduced coenzyme, FAD. There is also enough energy released to synthesize a molecule of ATP, since two turns occur per glucose molecule, that makes 2 ATP per glucose.

- NADH and FADH2 serve as important electron carriers for the electron transport chain. Molecules known as quinones also serve as carriers. Aswell as a series of pigmented cofactors called cytochromes. These molecules then serve as electron transferrers via oxidation-reduction reactions. So electrons are passed.

- At the end of the exchange is an oxygen molecule, which then becomes H2O, or water. This overall process is called cellular respiration. 

- As NADH and FADH2 transport electrons, energy is released to pump hydrogen ions to the outside of the cell membrane, this causes a high concetration outside. A force called the proton motive force then drives to protons across the membrane to equalize the concetrations. As the protons flow across the membrane, their energy is used to synthesize ATP from phosphate groups and ADP. This entire process is called chemiosmosis. 

- Oxidative phosphorylation is used for the process in which electrons are passed along and their energy is released to synthesize ATP molecules.

- For each NADH molecule matoblized, three ATP are synthesized, for each FADH2 it is 2 ATP. From oxidative phosphorylation about 34 molecules of ATP are produced, and to add to that, there are the 2 ATP from the two turns of the citric acid cycle. And also the two from glycolysis, this yields a net ATP of 38 per 1 glucose molecule.  

- Not all micros use these pathways, others use HMP or ED pathways. 

- Anaerobic respiration involves not using oxygen as a last receptor, it uses some other molecule, many micros use anaerobic respiration. 

- Some examples of molecules used in substitute of oxygen are nitrate and sulfate, aswell as CO2. These molecules are important in several cycles. ***Note: interesting how everything in biology builds off itself, it is like a chaotic fractal***

- Glucose doesnt need to be strictly used, you can get combinations that contain it, such as glucose binded with itself, or glucose binded with fructose, etc. 

- Polysaccharides are made up of glucose components and can also be broken down, but for cellulose (plant cell walls), it is pretty hard. Very few micros can actually break it down.
