- Microbiology is the study of micro organisms, which are just organisms you can only see with a microscope. 

- 99% of microorganisms are actually benificial to humans.

- Some microorganisms gain energy through photosynthesis. 

- From now on I will refer to microorganisms as "micros," as the alternative is too long. 

- Micros provide many uses such as keeping bacteria away in the case of normal flora, and also fermenting food. 

- Micros can kill us either by sheer numbers, producing toxins that interfere with out systems, or by creating toxins that destroy our cells. 

- In the early days, there was a theory called spontaneous generation, it stated that micros generated spontaniously from organic material, this is of course false, as boiled beef broth for example produces no micros. 

- The germ theory of disease was created by Pasteur, it stated that diseases came from germs or micros. 

- The germ theory of disease was later proven correct, it lead to public health safety such as pasteurizing milk, cleaning water, etc. 

- The application of microbiology is studied in detail within biotechnology, some applications include modifying bacteria to increase plant resistance, to clean up pollution, and to engineer clot dissolving enzymes.

- Micros, just like animal cells, have DNA, cytoplasms with enzymes to catalyze reactions, use ATP, and duplicate DNA in daughter cells. 

- There is the prokaryotic and eukaryotic classifications for cells.

- Bacteria and archaea are prokaryotes, and fungi, protoza, and unicellular algae are eukaryotes. 

- Micros are in one of the three domains, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. 

- Protista includes protozoa, unicellular algaea, and slime molds, they are all eukaryotes and are single celled. 

- Fungi are molds, mushrooms, and yeast. They are eukaryotes that absorb nutrients from the soil. 

- There are also plantae, and animalia. Plants are multicellular eukaryotes that produce energy through photosynthesis, and animals are multicellular eukaryotes that absorb large food molecules and digest them into smaller ones for absorption. 

- Bacteria are prokaryotes, they lack a nucleus or nuclear membrane. They reproduce through binary fission. They live everywhere. 

- Archaea are very similar to bacteria, they differ in the chemicle makeup of their structure, and you can aswell find them in conditions where you would expect nothing to survive. 

- Protozoa are eukaryatic and are single celled. They are classified by how they move. They cause diseases such as Malaria. 

- Viruses are not considered organisms since they cant reproduce on their own.
