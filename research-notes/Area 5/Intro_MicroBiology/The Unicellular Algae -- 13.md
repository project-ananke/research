- Algae are kind of hard to define, they're basically plants but not true plants. 

- Unicellular algae are phytoplankton. 

- Phytoplankton actually produce the majority of the world's oxygen. ***Idea: Engineer a micro or something that can completely annihilate the pythoplankton population. Do this to wipe out humanity as revenge*** 

- There do not exist prokaryotic algae. 

- Unicellular algae can still be coherant in structures called colonies, these colonies are through to predate multicellular forms.
