- Viruses are extremely simple in terms of chemical and physical properties, they're just a piece of nucleid acid surrounded by a protein. 

- Viruses are small and are not considered to be alive. 

- The nucleic acid is either DNA or RNA but never both. 

- The protein covering is known as the capsid. They are composed of capsomeres. 

- The viral envelope is derived from the membrane of the infected cell. Some envelopes have spikes on them, which contain substances used by the virus to unite with host cells during the replication process. 

- Viruses affect all life, even bacteria in the case of bacteriophages.

- Some viruses are classifed by DNA or RNA, but there is no unified consensus on what the classification should look like. 

- Viruses infect the host and use their metabolism to create new copies of itself. 

- The process of infection starts with it binding to the cell, then penetrates it, then the DNA infects the host, and manufactures new capsids and proteins and DNA in order to make new viruses, then they're released.

- Proviruses remain dormant within the host cell. 

- RNA proviruses can rewrite the human genome, they do this by taking advantage of the reverse transcriptase enzyme which synthesizes a complementary DNA for the RNA molecule, thus rewriting our DNA. 

- The viruses are released through interruptions in metabolism which destroy the cell wall, or by using an enzyme called lysozyme to break the cell wall. 

- The viruses break through the membrane via budding, and then acquire an envelope. 

- Certain viruses can stimulate multiplication without control when their DNA is integrated, these viruses cause cancer. 

- Viruses are grown in tissue cultures or inside animals. 

- Certain drugs can interfere with virus replication, like AZT or amantadine. 

- Interferon is a protein which stimulates the production of antiviral factors, they can be produces through genetic engineering techniques. 

- When viruses infect a cell it triggers antibodies to be released, which then bind to the capsids and are eventually eaten by phagocytes. 

- Vaccines help build immunity within humans, they are viruses without reproductive capabilities. 

- There are two types of viruses utilized within vaccines, inactivated viruses whos genomes have been destroyed. And attenuated viruses who are very weak and replicate slowly, though they elicit an immune response.
