- Mutations can cause permanent change to genetics. Acquired genes that cause change is called recombination. 

- When a nitrogenous base is replaced it is called point mutation, when a section of a chromosome is lost it is colled deletion mutation, when some DNA is replaced by identical DNA in reverse order it is an inversion mutation, when new sequences of nucleotides are added to a chromsome, it is insertion mutation. 

- If a permanent mutation occurs in the DNA, it can cause issues with protein synthesis and enzymes. 

- Anything that can cause mutations is called a mutagenic agent or mutagen. 

- There are two types of mutation, spontaneous mutations and induced mutations. Spontanous occur without human intervention. Induced may be brought about in labratories. 

- Frameshift mutation is when chemicals cause some bases to be lost from DNA. 

- In some cases mutations can be reversed. 

- Mutations are believed to be a cause for evolution within micros. ***I will note the importance of this, perhaps I will independantly investigate the theory of evolution.*** 

- Recombination deals with the acquisition of new DNA. 

- Newly reconstructed DNA is called recombinant DNA. 

- The 3 main methods for recombination within micros is transformation, conjugation, and transduction. 

- Transformation is when the bacteria takes up DNA from the enviroment, like when a bacteria dies or something. 

- Bacteria that can do transformation are said to be competent. 

- During transformation, the DNA is bound to a receptor site on the surface, it is then broken down and incorporated into the chromosome. 

- Bacteria have plasmids, which are extrachromosomal loops of DNA, they're essentially there for mutations. 

- Conjugation is basically sex between cells, they exchange genetic material. Possession of the F factor (F+ ) permits a bacterium to act as a donor, while absence of the F factor (Fâˆ’ ) indicates a recipient bacterium.

- During conjugation, a filamentous structure knows as the sex pilus attaches the two. Once this happens, a plasmid replicates within the donor cell. 

- Recombination can allow for new biochemical abilities, which can lead to an adaptation to the enviroment. 

- Genes that tansfer between plasmids are called transposons, these transposons can lead to bacteria resistant to multiple drugs. ***I will note this as a potential engineering challenge in the future.***

- Transduction varies considerably from the other two recombinant processes because it relies upon a virus to transfer DNA between donor and recipient bacteria.

- Viruses can sneak into the chromosome of a bacteria, remain dormant as a prophage, alter its DNA, then get replicated through fission. This is called specialized transduction. 

- In generalized transduction, the viruses enters the bacteria and immiedetly releases DNA. This is done by their DNA just attaching itself to the host's DNA.

- Isolating plasmids is one way in which scientists perform genetic engineering. 

- Some important enzymes are recombining plasmids are the endonucleases. These are also knows as restriction enzymes. 

- These enzymes are important as they essentially break open plasmids to access DNA. DNA ligase is then used to stitch together the ends of the plasmid and form a recombines DNA molecule. These molecules are called chimera. 

- A good use of this is insulin production, scientists actually inserted human plasmids into a bacteria in order to produce insulin, which is then sold to people with diabetus. 

- The antiviral protein interferon, genes for for the human growth hormone, clotting factor VIII, and clotting substance tissue plasminogen activator are some examples of compounds found in humans that were replicated or inserted into bacteria. 

- A good application for genetic engineering is biotechnology.
