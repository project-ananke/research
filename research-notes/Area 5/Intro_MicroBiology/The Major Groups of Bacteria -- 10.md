- Archaea are as group of micros that predate bacteria, they trace back over 3 billion years. They are tolerant to heat, acid, and toxic gases. They are believed to form during the intitial years of Earth. They are usually found in eviroments with methane, sulfuric acid, or heat. These mimick the early conditions of Earth.
