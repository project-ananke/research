- They vary mainly in structure, eukaryotes have a nucleus, organelles such as the golgi apparatus, mitochondria, etc. Their DNA is within multiple chromosomes. Prokaryotes on the other hand have one chromosome, smaller ribosomes, and no organelles and no nucleus. 

- The similarities include that they both reproduce, move around, have nucleic acid, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. They both also use glycolysis and chemiosmosis.

- Viruses are neither eukaryotic nor prokaryotic. 

- The two major groups of prokaryotes are bacteria and archaea, archaea are believed to be some of the first life on Earth. 

- There is sphere shaped bactera called coccus, rod called bacillusm and spiral called spirillum. The spiral is called spirochete if the cell wall is flexible. 

- Bacteria shape is determined by their chromosomes or DNA. Static shape is called monomorphic, changing shape is called pleomorphic. 

- Bacteria use flagella to move. They are elongated structures composed of a protein called flagellin. 

- The flagella has an elongated piece called the filament, the end of the filament called the hook, and the basal body which anchors it to the cell membrane. 

- Monotrichous bacteria have a single flagellum, amphitrichous bacteria have a flagellum on each end of the cell, lophotrichous bacteria have multiple at each end, and peritrichous have flagella all over the body,

- Not all bacteria have flagella. 

- Some bacteria can create a gelatinous layer of polysaccharides and proteins known as a capsule. The capsule protects it against eviromental changes and things like drugs and antibodies. It also helps it adhere to surfaces. 

- When the capsule is less firm and is slow moving it is called a glycocalyx or slime layer. 

- Many bacteria have pili or fimbriae, they are hair like structures made up of protein that allows it to attach to surfaces found on other species. Some are sex pili which transfer genetic information. 

- Mycoplasmas are the only bacteria without a cell wall. 

- The bacterial cell wall is simply made up of polysaccharides. 

- The cell membrane is two layered and consists of a bilayer. 

- There are gram positive and gram negative bacteria, this just means whether it has a thick cell wall or not. 

- The cell membrane is described the the fluid mosaic model, as constant movement of proteins in and out of the membrane causes a change in the structure. 

- The cell membrane is semi permissable, so small substances that can dissolve in lipids easily pass through.

- In simple diffusion, solute molecules move down the concetration gradient into the mebrane. In facilitated diffusion, they are assisted by proteins. 

- Osmosis is a specialized diffusion where water moves from a low concetration of solute thus a high concetration of water, to a lower concetration. This is enabled by the water pressure or osmotic pressure. Water wont move if the concetration is uniform, this is called isotomic. Hypertonic is when the concetration is different from the enviroment so water will move. 

- Active transport is the movement of molecules against the gradient and it needs ATP in order to do this.

- The DNA of a prokaryote is packed tightly into a region called the nucleoid.  

- DNA is also stored in some bacteria within plasmids within their cytoplasm. This DNA is often used to express genes whos function provides antibacterial resistance, these plasmids can also encode enzymes. Plasmids are usually taken advantage of within genetic engineering. 

- Ribosomes are free within the cytoplasm of the prokaryote. 

- Inclusions are various kinds of ultramicroscopic bodies. In prokaryotic cells, inclusions may contain polysaccharides, lipids, sulfur, phosphate, or other important materials needed for the biochemistry of the cell.

- Some bacteria can create highly resistant structures called spores to revert to in the case that the enviroment is unfavorable.

- Spores are some of the most resistant life forms on earth.

- Eukaryotic cells also have flagella. Some have shorter more numerous structures called cilia, both are microtubule structures. 

- Most protozoal dont have cell walls, but some have an outer layer called a pellicle.

- Cell membranes of eukaryotic cells use the fluid mosaic model, but the proteins on their membrane differ from prokaryotes. Their membranes also contain sterols. 

- Eukaryotes can bring material into the cell through endocytosis where they essentially wrap themselves around it, when it is choosy it is called phagocytosis. When the material is dissolved in liquid, it is called pinocytosis. 

- Eukaryotes also have a cytoskeleton within their cytoplasm, it is a structure of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. 

- Eukaryotes also have a nucleus, it has a nuclear envelope which is a double membrane, it also contains a nucleoli which produces RNA, it is suspended in a fluid called nucleoplasm. 

- Eukaryotes have endoplasmic reticulum, the smooth ER has no ribosomes and produces lipids, the rough ER is the opposite. The rough ER produces glycoproteins. 

- The golgi apparatus is responsible for sorting, packaging, and releasing many cellular proteins and lipids. 

- The mitochondria has internal membrane structures called cristae, along the cristae are cofactors and enzymes responsible for energy metabolism. 

- Chloroplasts are organelles responsible for photosynthesis, they are found within eukaryotic plant cells. Chlorophyll and other molecules needed for photosynthesis are stored here, the membranes are called thylakoid and stacks of them are called grana. 

- Lysosomes are membrane bound structures found in eukaryotic cells, they are responsible for breaking things down in order to release nutrients.
