- This chapter is pretty self explanitory, it's about controling the growth and spread of micros. 

- Some chemicals break down their molecules, cytoplasm, or membrane to kill micros. 

- Organic matter musnt exist if anitmicrobial agents are to be used. 

- Sterilization is the eradication of all micros including spores. 

- Disinfection is just killing pathogenic micros. 

- Antibiotics are used inside the host. 

- Sanitization is the reduction of a population of micros to a safe level. 

- The easiest way to kill micros is with heat. 

- Autoclaves boil water and heat up the steam further to create conditions in which spores die. 

- Moist heat causes denaturation where proteins seperate as an insoluble mass that converts from 3d to 2d. Dry heat is oxidation. 

- Tynadalization is exposing a liquid to free flowing steam

- Pasteurization lowers the levels of micros in milk and kills pathogenic micros. 

- Lowering the temperature like in fridges and freezers slow the metabolism of micros. 

- Salt drives water from food through osmosis, drying food can lower micro population be reducing the water. 

- Ionizing radiation and uv light can kill micros by messing with their DNA. 

- Microwaves cause water molecules in food to vibrate generating heat, this heat can kill other micros. 

- High frequency sound waves can also destroy micros. They do this by coagulating proteins and disintegrating cellular components. 

- Filters can have openings larger than water molecules but small than lets say a spore in order to not allow micros inside, this makes the water move slowly though. 

- ETO, formaldehyde, and BPL are chemicals commonly used as sterilizers. 

- 70% rubbing alchohol of both types can be used for 20 minutes to destroy the proteins within micros. 

- Silver and Mercury are good for killing micros. 

- Changing the pH levels of micros can also kill them. 

- Chlorine and iodine are halogens that can be used as oxidizing agents to change the nature of proteins killing the micro. 

- Antibiotics are products of micros that inhibit the growth of other micros. 

- Antibacterial resistant strains of bacteria always existed within populations, but they never needed to use their resistance mechanism until recently, the surviving bacteria are the ones that use this mechanism. Thus over time we get antibacterial resistant bactera. ***Question: how and why do they have this mechanism in the first place?*** 

- Micros can release enzymes to deactivate the antibiotic, change its structure to make it not sensitive, or change the structure of their membrane to restrict access. 

- Different antibiotics can be of various generations, essentially denoting new functionality. 

- There exist antibiotics for fungi but not for viruses because they have little structure that can actually be interfered with. 

- AZT, acyclovir, ganiclovir, amantadine, and interferon are some examples of antiviral antibiotics.
