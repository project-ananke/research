- Our first defense against pathogens is our outside barrier like our skin. 

- Mucus is a defense against pathogens, it traps particles that enter the tract, the cilia then moves it to the throat where it is swallowed. Another defenses are tears which flush the eyes, urine flow, and the release of dead skin cells. 

- Our body also uses enzymes and acids to fight off these pathogens. The vagina has high acid content. ***Idea: Create a mathematical model for the acid secretion within the vagina.*** 

- ***Idea: Create a micro that targets helpful normal flora within the body, not the body itself, then see what happens. Experiment this on homeless population.*** 

- Inflammation is an attempt to localize the infection and destroy pathogens. 

- Fever makes the eviroment more effecient for phagocytosis, it also speeds up blood to the infection site. 

- We have innate immunity and acquired immunity. 

- Innate immunity is due to physical properties, like not having receptor sites. 

- Acquired immunity is the type of immunity that results from exposure to pathogens. 

- Acquired active immunity comes from a pathogenic infection, passive comes from your mother. 

- A vaccine is artificial acquired active immunity, injecting anti bodies is passive. 

- Antigens are substances that stimulate a specific immune response. 

- The human immune system is structured in two major arms, one arm is centered in a set of cells called B lymphocytes, while the other is centered in T lymphocytes. B functions in the form of anti body mediated immunity, the T is cell mediated immunity. 

- T cells originate from stem cells in the bone marrow. 

- Different T cells may respond to different antigens, this depends on the surface receptor molecules on the T cell. 

- When macrophages and monocytes enter the lymphoid tissue, B cells respond, they differentiate into plasma cells. 

- Helper T cells assist in binding the macrophage and B cell together. 

- Plasma cells once formed produce many many antibody molecules. 

#### I will stop at right about here, the rest of the book is about diseases and immune response. I dont need this right now. I will most likely return to this area of study for future inquiries or potential project ideas.
