- Protozoa are eukaryotic micros which are most animal like. They are unicellular though. 

- Protozoa are heterotrophic and get food through organic molecules. 

- Most protozoa live in aquatic enviroments. 

- Protozoa dont have cell walls, they have cell membranes, they also have organelles found in eukaryotes. 

- Protozoa have a micronuclei and a large macronucleus, each has its own function. 

- They have different morphological forms, they can be in a feeding form called a trophozoite, or a protective and reproductive form called a cyst. They can also reproduce through fusion. 

- Almost all of them reproduce asexually, mitosis occurs and two genetic daughter cells result. 

- They also have a sexual mode in which they undergo meiosis to create a haploid nuclei. 

- Protozoa are identified based off their motility.

- The sexual reproduction can occur with conjugation and or the transferring and fusion of haploids. ***Note: incorporate this later.***

- Protozoa's main contribution to nature is their ability to bring energy into the food chain, either by consuming bacteria, then themselves getting consumed, or by releasing the glucose within cellulose. 

- Water molds and slime molds used to be classified as fungi, but they're now protozoa.
