- All micros except viruses which arent alive exhibit growth behavior. Growth is just the expansion of organic material through mitosis or fission.

- The two patterns for division is mitosis in eukaryotes, and fission in prokaryotes.

- Mitosis is a more complex fission, it is the duplication of DNA, then the splitting off of a cell. 

- Growth factors and specific proteins are in charge of the regulation of the progression of this cycle. 

- In the early phase of the cell cycle known as mitosis, DNA duplicates, chromatin condenses forming distinct sets of chromosomes, the nucleus then dissapears,  and the centrioles move to the poles of the cell and form spindle fibers of microtubules, this is called prophase. 

- After prophase is metaphase, the replicated chromosomes line up in the equatorial plate of the cell, spindle fibers continue to grow, and the chromatids attach to eachother at the centromere. 

- After metaphase is anaphase, in this phase, chromatids are split and one set of chromosomes is draw to either side of the cell by spindle fibers. 

- Telophase is when the chromosomes arrive at the poles and become an amorphous mass of chromatin. 

- Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm and the forumation of new cells, this involves the synthesis of a cell membrane at the center of the cell and cytoplasmic seperation in the two daughter cells. The cell nucleus then reappears in the daughter cells as the nuclear envelope is synthesized.

- Binary fission is how bacteria replicate, they replicate their chromosomes then split off.

- When micros are exposed to a culture medium, there is first a lag phase in which the micros grow in size, accumulate organic matter, and store energy. Next is log phase, this is rapid cell division, it increases size at a logarithmic or exponential rate. 

- After is stationary phase, where the rate of cell division decreases. The final phase is the decline phase, it is when cell death exceeds the rate of cell division.

- ***Idea: make sure the model fits this graph*** 

- Obligate micros live in specific enviroments, facultative live in several. 

- Psychrophiles which are a type of bacteria, grow best at 5 to 20 degrees c, mesophiles at 20 to 40, and thermophiles from 40 to 80 or even as high as 110. 

- Some bacteria need oxygen, they are called aerobic, others dont and are anaerobic, of these, some are obligate anaerobes meaning they live with oxygen, and others are facultative anaerobes meaning that they dont. 

- Microaerophilic grow best when there is little oxygen, capnophiles grow best with carbon dioxide. 

- Bacteria living from 0 pH to 5 are acidophiles, 5 to 8.5 are neutrophiles, and alkaline pH are alkalinophiles. 7 to 11.5. 

- Micros usually need water to do reactions, however, fungi produce spores that survive in moisture free eviroments, and certain protoza produce resistant cysts, and bacterial spores are the most resistant structures known to science. 

- Micros are all over the place, some even exist in high radiation enviroments. ***Idea: simulate the evolution within these enviroments***. 

- Micros have specific mediums to be cultivated in, ranging from solid to liquid/broth, to even animal matter. ***Idea: produce model to simulate the evolution of achieving specific mediums***. 

- Selective media are those that prohibit the growth of another bacteria. 

- Differential medium means that certain bacteria will exhibit different qualities. Such as one bacteria appearing red.
