- Parasitism is when one benifits where the other is harmed, mutalism is where it benifits both. 

- Infection is living with the host, disease is actively damaging the host. 

- Commensalism is where one benifits where as the other is left unchanged. 

- We first get out normal flora (good bacteria population) from our mothers. 

- Normal flora are usually kept in check by our body, but damage to our body could cause the normal flora to harm us, like yeast infections. ***Idea: Simulate yeast infections within mathematical model of human vagina.*** 

- Virulence is the degree of pathogenicity within micros. (potential for causing disease)

- Opportunistic micros invade tissue when given the opportunity, this usually happens in the weakened bodies of cancer patients. 

- Infectious dose is the amount of invading micros revieved by the host. ***Idea: Use these concepts of messurement to record and update data actively within a simulation.*** 

- Infectous dose is high within raw sea food from contaminated water for example. ***Idea: Weaponize this.*** 

- The mechanism for entry of a pathogen is portal of entry, most come from external sources. Most micros have only 1 portal of entry. ***Idea: Work with the Chinese to create a virus of multiple portals of entry.*** 

- Certain micros are toxic, in that they contain chemicals which can affect your function. Some toxins can interrupt your respritory function or can interrupt your synapses causing muscle paralysis. Toxins can come from exotoxins (produced by micro) or endotoxins (released upon death). 

- There are localized infections in which an infection is located at a specific part of the body. And there are systematic infections where they spread to deeper parts of the body. 

- Acute infections come rapidy with severe symptoms that reach a climax, chronic infections are more mild but last a long time. 

- A sign is an objective observation which indicates a disease, where as a symptom is subjective. 

- Pathogens need a portal of exit to infect others, like shit or coughing. 

- Endemics are within a human population and persist over a long period of time. Epidemics are rapid and spread to one specific reagion, pandemics are epidemics but world wide. 

- Reservoir are creatures with the pathogen who dont show symptoms and spread it. Carriers recovered from the disease but still spread it. ***Idea: Engineer a pathogen that takes advantage of both in order to increase its contangency. Make this pathogen secrete different toxins that are exotoxic and endotoxic, work with the Chinese on this.*** 

- Vectors are animals that can transmit diseases to humans. 

- A disease is communicable if it can spread. 

- Horizontal spread is disease spread through human population, vertical spread is passed down to generations. 

- Direct methods are spreading diseases through contact with a micro, indirect is through inanimate objects.
