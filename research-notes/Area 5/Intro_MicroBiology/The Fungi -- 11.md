- Fungi are more complicated than bacteria as they are eukaryotes with multiple chromosomes. 

- Fungi have rigid cell walls and get energy through chemical reactions rather than photosythesis. Some are unicellular, others are multicellular. 

- Mycelium is the branching of multicellular fungi, they exhibit very complicated behavior.

- Fungi are heterotrophic and get energy from the eviroment via organic molecules. 

- Fungi reproduce through spores, one spore can create a whole mycelium. 

- Asexual reproduction occurs in the aerial hyphae, mitosis also occurs here.

- Yeast (single celled fungi) undergo mitosis and produce a bud, this bud grows in size and eventually seperates, this process is called budding. 

- There actually exists sexual reproduction within fungi, they prodce haploid gametes, each contain a single chromosome. These gametes are produced by the parents of opposite sexual types. Gamete production occurs via meiosis, these gametes can fuse to form zygotes. The zygote either stays with the parent mycelium until it breaks free, or it immedietly breaks free to start its own mycelium. ***Idea: My current thinking is to simulate plasmids of bacteria within a network, something more complicated would be to simulate the sexual passing off of genetics for something even as simple as a fungus.*** 

- Mycelium may contain both male and female cells that reproduce with eachother.

- Pathogens are found in every class of fungi. 

- Many species of fungi exist together in nature with other organisms in symbiotic relationships. This symbiosis, called mutualism, is mutually beneficial to the fungus and the other organism. One example of mutualism is the lichen. In this relationship, fungi coexist with simple algae. The algal cells perform photosynthesis and provide carbohydrates for themselves and the fungus; the fungus shields the algal cells from high- intensity light and protects it from drying out, while providing valuable nutrients. Lichens are crusty, colored growths found on many rocks and tree trunks ***Note: An accurate model for whatever level of intelligence this is would need to exhibit behavior as complicated of mutalism, I am guessing that most the intelligence within lower level organisms are essentially advanced guessing machines rather than networks that exhibit a type of back propogation, this random structure would need to exhibit this.*** 

- Another example of mutualism is the mycorrhiza, an association between a fungus and the root of a plant. Mycorrhizae happen on the roots of many forest trees. The fungus obtains many nutrients from the plants, and, in turn, helps the plant root absorb soil nutrients
