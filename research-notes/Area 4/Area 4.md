## Notes Taken From Sapolsky Lectures: 

 
 - The rediscovery of logic spiked up a revolution within Europe.

- Reductionism: to understand a complex system break it down into its fundementals. 
Starting state of a complex system allows for causality. Reductive systems allow you to use causality to just explain things that are complex 
given an already known variable. Reductionism reduces variability. An interesting note is that certain biological structures have reductionism, 
an example being neurons in the visual cortex and retina cells corresponding to eachother.

 - Sequential reductivity can allow for complex behavior,
an example is the "grandmother neuron" this is called sparse coding. Reductionism breaks down when you get to bifurcation and recognition, simply put the system branches out to a degree where there aren't enough neurons or genes to account for it, therefore reductionism breaks down. Chance 
also breaks down reductionism. Reductionism breaks down at a lot of natural occurrences. 

 - Chaos is the absence of periodicity. An interesting note is that odd number of repitions in a cycle implies chaos. Modification to system cause it 
to converge back to the ideal state of the system. One graphical representation of chaos is this type of butterfly pattern. 
#1:10:25 

 - The butterfly affect suggest that minor changes can cause massive outcomes. A fractal is a scale free pattern. Fractals are important as they can 
set rules that are independent of scale. The fractal interpretation bassicly describes variance as a part of the system.

 - One interesting study is: 
	to study variation at different levels, like from  behavior to physiology to organs to cells, the coefficient of variation was fairly constant, 
	there was no trend of variability decreasing, thus a proof against reducibility because it is a fractal systems. 


 - Cellular automata are a good representation of fractals. Most ca have random patterns or patterns that end, ca are bassicly non linear systems, 
the initial state is not enough to predict the future. There are extinction where patterns die. Different starting states and rules produce vastly 
different results. Some patterns converge, for example completely unrelated plants converging to the same shape. Apparently you can predict 
divergence and convergence within ca. Networks, as in neural networks is what allows for pattern recognition. 

 -  tree biphorcation is based on fractal genes, when branches get a certain size one splits off and grows to a certain length or something like that. #36:33 fractals also create
impossible shapes that exist between 1 and 2 dimensions, or so I heard. They are impossible as they can have infinite points so like an infinite 
perimeter whilst also taking up a finite space. This is how you get structures like the circulatory systems which is virtually everywhere but takes 
up very little space. The average of guesses between experts on some problem is usually correct, this is described as wisdom of the crowd. 
	Shortest possible path problems can be solved with virtual ants, essentially a bunch of swarms that over several generations show the most 
	intelligent path, swarm intelligence. You can also have attractive repulsion rules, so like competitive stores are all not so close to each other

## Emergence: 
 - Many dumb, simple things, can create very complicated and sophisticated 
	systems. It is complexity arrises from simplicity. An example being the 
	intelligent strucutre of a bunch of dumb and simple ants. The properties 
	of water is also a good example, the properties of individual molecules 
	make up complex behavior. This is essentially done through simple rules.
	The cells within our bodies just act based on rules, they dont have some master
	control system.  

 -  I will list spme examples of emergence 
	 -  snow flake formations 
	
	 - magnetic behavior from atomic alignments 
	
	 - weather patterns or just weather in general 
	
	 - bird formations
	
	 -  properties of crystal lattice structures

		

 - The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is stated that phenomona such as life and intelligence can be explained through emergence. 

- Most scientists view more complex emergence as phase transitions, an example being literal phase transitions, the rules of how atoms interact with eachother can cause it to change phases depending on the enviroment around it. 

- Another interesting example is the bridge structure of ants. Basically, ants maintain a close distance with its neighbors, thus when they cross some open area, lets say across two leaves seperated by some distance, then the rule of closenss causes them to actually bridge across. This is also when ants fall down, they form a tight knit group because of these old rules. 

- Emergence is being used as a framework for areas of science, some examples being the firing of neurons, the movement of cells (during organ growth), and even engineering. 

- Condensed matter physics is a prime field for emergence. One example being the propogation of waves within condensed matter systems. Quantum mechanical systems also have particles being wave like structures. 

- Condensed matter physics has something called quasi-particles, they are essentially particles that behave like particles, but still have wave behavior, and also be a collective system that moves together. 

- Conductivity is an emergent property, aswell as color, viscosity, and much more. These are not properties that can be analyzed on the scale of the atom, they are properties that can only be observed from the system as a whole. 

- There is strong emergence and weak emergence. 

- Weak emergence means that the property of emergence can be derived from the properties of its constituents. An example being conductivity. 

- Weak emergence is alway found in physics, in fact, all emergent properties within physics fall under weak emergence. 

- Strong emergence describes that it is possible that systems with many constituents displace the novel behavior of its constituents, thus making a property that can not be derived from its constituents. 

- Strong emergence does not occur within nature, but it can be artificially created. An example being photographic mosaics. Given a bunch of pictures you cannot tell what the emergent mosaic would look like. 

- There is no scientific basis for strong emergence, mainly as this type of emergence entails that there exists objects which go against the standard model of particle physics. 

- Some think that conciousness and intelligence are strongly emergent, but there is no evidence for this and most believe the contrary, that it is weakly emergent. 

- One way to think about emergence is like layers being stacked on eachother. Each layer coincides with increased complexcity and new phenomena. 

## Emergence SC Pepper: 

 - There seems to be 3 different ways to describe change from the perspective of metaphysical philosphy, one of them being Emergence. 

 - I will note that Emergence itself originated from philosophy and later found scientific grounding. 

 - The first type is described as chance occurence: an occurence in which no cosmic law can be stated. Or, cosmic irregularity. This is essentially just probabilistic unlikelihood. 

 - The second type is defined as a "shift" basically, one characteristic replaces another, this is typically called invariable succession. 

 - The third and final type is called emergenece; emergence is simply cummulitive change, or characteristic supervening other characteristics, with that characteristic being adequate to its level. All this really means is that emergence is the phenomena of different properties emerging new ones as the system grows. 

-  I will further note that this paper was written in 1926, I am noting this as philosphy preceded science in this case, this should not go unnoticed. 

- The theory of emergence as described by philosophy involved three propositions
	1. There are levels of existence defined by levels of *integration*. In other words, a system can be defined by different levels of complexcity and observation. 

	 2. Any observed level has individual and unique marks. Basically every level has unique characteristics. 

	 3. It is impossible to deduce the marks of higher levels from observations of lower levels, the same may or may not be true of deducing marks of lower levels from higher levels. All this means is that the system cant be predicted by modeling its constintuent parts. 

	 - I encourage us to take some time to contemplate this. To contemplate that abstract reasoning has predicted one of the most important aspects of science, and to further contemplate the length of time it took for science to adopt the concept of emergence. 

	 - *integration*: consolidating constintuent parts into a whole. 

- The theory of emergence has some dilemmas, 2 to be exact from this source 

	1. Either that emergent change is not cumulative or it is *epiphenomenal*. 

	2. Either that emergent change is predictable just like any physical change or it is *epiphenomenal*. 

	- *Epiphenomenal*: A secondary phenomena caused by another; typically accomponies another phenomena. This comes from *epiphenomenalism*

	- *Epiphenomenalism*: There are different definitions I found based on the subject it is used in. I will describe it as abstract phenomena emerging from physical events, with these emergent phenomena not affecting the physical. 

- The text describes something called emergent evolutionists, perhaps they are people that study this. 

- The text takes a more abstract path from here. Something interesting it talks about is that functions of certain variables at a certain level can only be described by one corresponding level function. I suppose a way to think about this is that emergence only allows you to describe things unique to that level with some functon that is also unique to that level. In other words, you cannot predict the molecular behavior of freezing dropping water from the observations of a snowflake nor the observations of the atoms themselves. 

- Emergent law must be described by emergent variables, these variables do ***not*** have to be described by an interrelational function with lower variables. Let us note that most examples of emergence are epiphenomenal 

- The text speaks on the cosmic vs the human perspective. That nothing is cosmically deducable only humanly deducable. It says that all events occur, they do not necassarily depend on eachother, that it is humans that describe these things and attribute events to laws and rules and such. 

- I will take an interesting excerpt from the text which I believe is interesing: "There is a loose sense in whieh qualities and events are predictable. Thus by a process of interpolation we can and have predicted the properties of missing elements in the periodic table. And by a process of analogy we predict the states of consciousness of other people and of animal"

- Most systems in physics are derived from more fundemental theories and are thus predictable. Emergence bassically says that is not possible. This basically the significance of epiphenomenalism within science. 

- One interesting question I found in the book is this: "Are present electrons functions of future electrons or past electrons?" I think perhaps not, from what I recall, the schrodinger equation is not dependant on information about the past electrons, its boundary conditions are just the bounds of the system itself. 

- This concludes my notes on the text. 

## The Concept of Emergence P.E. MEEHL, WILFRED SELLARS: 
 
 - Interestingly enough, this paper builds off the SC Pepper paper, it more so dives deeper into it. 

 - So far he just seems to be restating what Pepper has said, with an emphasis on epiphenomenalism. 

 - Imagine two arrows both pointing to the right, think that node 0 implies 1 which implies 2. Then imagine node 2 having an arrow which points to H, this basic image is a visualization of epiphenomenalism. 

 - The text basically speaks more on the uniqueness of H, and how it is has characteristics not present in non-H situations. 

 - I will note the existence of one prominant figure within emergence, he is often refered to as "Alexander."

 - node 0 to 1 to 2 are shifts, node 1 to H is a supervenience. 

 - The paper speaks on the reducibility of some things, it questions whether it is accurate to constantly count out reducibility, biology to organic chemistry is an example given. 

 - The paper makes the claim that the theory of emergence has more application in science than in philosophy. 

 - The rest of the paper speaks on the functional relationship of emergent properties with their  variables, varying at different levels, and so on. We can later reference it if we so desire. 

## Strong and Weak Emergence -- David J. Chalmers:
 
  -  The concept of emergence has two descriptions as layed out by philosophers, that being strong emergence and weak emergence. 

  - You may say that something is strongly emergent with respect to a lower level phenomenon if that strongly emergent property is not deducible from the the lower level phenomenon. 

  - You may say that one high level phenomenon is weakly emergent with respect to a lower level phenomena if that emergent pheomenon is deducible and directly caused by the lower level phenomena. 

  - *Cellular Automata* are good examples of weak emergence; they can be deduced from the basic rules albeit they must also be calculated.

	    Cellular Automata : 2 or 3 dimensional cells that interact with eachother based off computational rules that are established by the programmer. 

  - The consequence of strong emergence is an entierely new set of fundemental laws of physics. 

  - I will note that strongly emergent phenomena has yet to be discovered. 

  - The paper argues that conciousness is a strongly emergent phenomena, I am note entirely sure whether this is true or not. 

  - I will quote the arguments for the above proclamation here: 

	     "First, it seems that a colourblind scientist given complete physical knowledge about brains could nevertheless not deduce what it is like to have a conscious experience of red. Secondly, it seems logically coherent in principle that there could be a world physically identical to this one, but lacking consciousness entirely, or containing conscious experiences different from our own."

  - Strongly emergent phenomena can still be correlated to a physcical state. The example the text gives is that if you were to replicate the brain you would also replicate the conciousness. 

  - Strongly emergent phenomena can be thought of as being emergent and dependant on a lower level, whilst also not being deducible by it. 

  - I will note the existance of something called configuration laws, which connect configurations to consequences, it was developed by McLaughlin (1993). 

  - The text references quantum mechanics as having some strange emergent properties. I would rather just note them than take note *of them* as I dont have a proper understanding of quantum mechanics yet. 

  - I will note strong downward causation which basically states that high level phenomena cant be deduced when given initial conditions and laws. Of course, weak downard causation is the exact opposite. 

 - The text notes some interesting examples of weak emergence, I will list them below:

	    (A) The game of Life: high-level patterns and structure emerge from simple low-level rules. 
  
	    (B) Connectionist networks: high-level ‘cognitive’ behaviour emerges from simple interactions between simple threshold logic units. 
 
	    (C) The operating system (Hofstadter 1977): the fact that overloading occurs just around when there are thirty-five users on the system seems to be an emergent property of the system. 
 
	    (D) Evolution: intelligence and many other interesting properties emerge over the course of evolution by genetic recombination, mutation, and natural selection.

 - This concludes the notes taken on the text. It would do us some good to further investigate the list located above.
