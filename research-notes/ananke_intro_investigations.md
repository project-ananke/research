Problem: We need to figure out what fundementally causes intelligence. 

Information: 
what even is intelligence? Perhaps its just a mechanism to solve problems. 
intelligence itself is very broad. High level intelligence begets councesness. 
To define it fudimentary as tools: the ability to gather information, to store
information, and to use it to learn. Learning can be described as repeatable
behaviors that can be varied and adapted. There have been multiple studies done
in which varias animals were trained to perform what amounts to intelligent 
behavior in order to gain some reward. Creativity is a phenomena of intelligence,
it revolves around making new and often times unusual connections between already 
known information and expierence to create something completely new. Planning
is another phenomena of intelligence, it involves getting information and forumulating
acitivities required for a desire goal and piecing them together in such a fasion 
as to achieve a desired goal. An example of planning is hoarding food to eat later
Squirrels exhibit remarkable planning abilites, going so far as to only stash
certain nuts such as nuts that still need to ripen, and to make fake stashes 
in an attempt to trick any other squirrel that may be watching them. If you 
consider concousness as a ladder, the least consiousness would be a basic 
organism who follows by their prime directive of survival, bassicly just 
going around and mindlessly consuming food and reporducing. One level 
above this would be actively percieving what is necassary, seeking out food
and shelter and the neccessities but also being able to see these things aswell
as obstacles. The next level would be to memorize these things, being able to
store in its abstract mind what is a neccessity and in its absence still pursue 
it, memory also allows for more complex behavior such as memorizing where food
can be located or memorizing paths to get to those locations. Memory also allows
for memorizing where things are located even when you cannot percieve it. The 
next level is perception of time, such as waiting for a larger reward or something
along those lines. The next level from this is to essentially empathize, 
knowing that some animal may try to take food that you hid away takes the 
ability to put yourself in its shoes, to understand that it too is hungry 
and wants food. Empathy can also allow us to understand the pain of others
which can lead to kindness and cooperation. The next level from this is 
language, the ability to represent abtract concepts and then communicate them
as to share ideas and information to accomplish harder tasks. One idea
is that the simple rule is to get as much food as humanly possible, I am 
relluctant to subsribe to this idea. Emergence is another phenomena of 
singular organisms coming together to do remarkably intelligent things, 
such as ants cooridnating an entire colony. One idea is that emergence occurs
through simple rulesets that produce order out of chaos. An example of a complicated 
structure being composed of simple individual parts would be an organ, a heart
is remarkable complex compared to its cells. The cells themselves share 
chemicle information with eachother and then subsequently decide what they 
need to do. Its all based on individual units interacting with their neigbors
and acting according to the feedback they get. A complex system could be a nation
a nation emerges from humans themselves. Something unique that happened with 
the emergence of life is the relationship with the mitochondria and living cells. 
Mitochondria used to be living bacteria until they essentially merged with
our precursors cells. This lead to the bacteria no longer being alive in 
exchange for their dna to pass on. Mitochondia arent alive anymore, doing 
so in exchange to pass on their dna. One interesting question derived from 
some of my research is "Is our intelligence an emergent property of our 
neuron cells in our brain?" 


Topics: (1)(gathering information, storing information, learning, creativity, planning,) (2)(perception of time and surrounding in general, empathy, language,) (3)(emergence) 
(4)(intelligence as an emergent property of neurons?)  
(4) -> (3)? -> (1) ->(2) //(4) being a potential principle, (3) being the potential cause of intellect, (1) being the components of intelligence, (2) being
products of intelligence. 


Furter topics: 

(1) Research the fundemental theorems of intelligence, be them neuron based or otherwise. //2 factor theory, Gardeners multiple intelligence, Triarchic theory of intelligence, Spearmans general intelligence, Thurstones primary abilites, Emotional intelligence?, Fluid vs crystalized intelligence?, Binet simon scale?, Stanford Binet intelligence scale?, WISC and WIAS?, The flynn effect?, Aptitude vs achievement tests? Reliability and construct validity!, Cultural specifity!, Social and enviromental factors!, Streyotype threat!, Self fulfilling prophecy!
(2) Research the phenomena of emergence more, perhaps see its application to (1) //brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, white matter integrity, cortical thickness, neural effeciency, (neural basis of intelligence) 
(3) Research the components of intelligence more //information gathering, storing information, learning, creativty, planning, communication, empathizing, awareness/perception in general, 
(4) Researcht the products of intelligence more //planning, communication, cultures, societies big or small, self awareness/conciousness, empathizing, creativity, problem solving in general like inventions and what not, ethics?, philosphy?,
