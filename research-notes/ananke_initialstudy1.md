# 4 Main Areas of Initial Study 

## Area 1:
It's apparent that components, examples, and products of intelligence are neccessary to analyze on a basis of ascending order, from dumber than fuck animals, all the way up to an idealized sentiant being. I will identify the ascending order. 

0. Animals of the microscopic scale. Think viruses', bacteria, single celled organisms etc. Find examples of level 0 creatures and describe their behavior and the aspects of their intelligence, this may be them attempting to acquire food, or in significant cases, them merging with other level 0 creatures. Should there be any confusion on how toanalyze them just ask me. 

1. Animals of the smaller scale that exhibit higher abilites. An example would be fungi, they're small but they are capable of forming complicated networks. I will also include animals such as plankton, shrimp, and creatures like that. Again, analyze their behavior and describe in detail the components of their intelligence aswell as the products of their intelligence. 

2. Larger scale sea based life and insects and other stuff. Fishes, sharks, stuff like that. Exlude highly intelligent animals such as octopi and dolphins. For this level and anysubsequent level, simply describe their behavior, the components of their intelligence, and the products of their intelligence. 

3. Highly intelligent animals. Animals like octopi, squirrels, ravens, doplhins, bassically any animal that isnt a monkey. 

4. Apes. Gorrilas, chimps, bassicly just monkeys. 

5. Humans. This shouldnt be hard, just describe the intelligent behavior of humans, components of our intelligence, and the products of our intelligence. 

6. Idealized sentiant life. Dont do this one. I will probably tackle this one on my own at a later time. 

## Area 2:
Theories of intelligence and meassurements of intelligence. Aswell as counter arguments to these meassurements. 

**THEORIES:**
- 2 factor theory 
- Gardeners multiple intelligence 
- Triarchic theory of intelligence
- Spearmans general intelligence 
- Thurstones primary abilites 

**MEASUREMENTS:** 
- Emotional intelligence 
- Fluid vs crystalized intelligence 
- Binet simon scale 
- Stanford Binet intelligence scale 
- WISC and WIAS 
- The flynn effect
- Aptitude vs achievement tests 

**COUNTER ARGUMENTS:**
- Reliability and construct validity
- Cultural specifity
- Social and enviromental factors
- Streyotype threat 
- Self fulfilling prophecy

## Area 3:
neural basis of all the theories. Bassicly just search up white papers on the neural basis using sci-hub 

## Area 4: 
Research far deeper into the phenomena of emergence. Research its fundementals, its history, examples within it, and any theories regarding it.
