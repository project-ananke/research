- The suggested location for neural functionality of EI is the PFC. 

- The way to meassure EI is through the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test.

- The study uses an interesting method, it analyzes brain injury to see where locations correspond to loss of functionality, it was found that the dorsolateral PFC is critical for EI. 

- The ventromedial PFC is considered crucial to EI. It is said to help mediate knowledge. Damage to this area of the brain can cause things like social incomptenance and changes to mood and personality. 

- The study states that there is suffecient evidence to suggest that disctinct neural substrates in the PFC are responsible for EI. 

- damages to the diPFC causes harm to experential EI and the ability to process emotional information. 

- I will include an important excerpt 

		Importantly, we stress that our findings highlight only two essential brain structures underlying key competencies of EI. Because vmPFC and dlPFC are higher-order association areas, it is likely that broadly distributed neural systems, incorporating subcortical limbic structures, such as the amygdala, which mediates emotional processes, and closely associated regions, such as the insula, cingulate cortex, and parietal cortices, which influence emotionally related behaviors (4, 37, 57, 58), will play important roles in subcomponents of EI. Future studies will need to examine each of these regions and their connectivity.

- I will also include an excerpt describing the statistical models used in the study for the sake of future use. 

		Statistical Analysis. Behavioral data analysis was carried out using SPSS 11.0 (www.spss.com; SPSS), and alpha was set to P 0.05 (two-tailed) for all analyses. Data were tested for Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and variance homogeneity (Bartlett’s test). Unless otherwise specified, data were normally distributed, and assumptions for analyses of variance were not violated. The Experiential and Strategic EI scores of the experimental groups were z-transformed in relation to normal group’s performance. A mixed two-way 2 (EI) 2 (group) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied with EI (Experiential versus Strategic) as a within-subject factor and Group (dlPFC versus vmPFC) as a between subject factor. Planned follow-up independent-samples t tests were applied to compare performances between the experimental groups.
