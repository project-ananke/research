- This study essentially works by using positron emmision topography to meassure the neural activation of different areas of the brain when performing high g tasks, this is meassured against the control task which are low g tasks. 

- Let us recall that the purpose of g factor is to explain the fact that people tend to *generally* do well in relating but not identicle tasks. 

- The main hypothesis tested by this study was to see whether high g correlation was associated with recruitment of the pre frontal cortex. 

- The alternate hypothesis to this was the Thomson hypothesis, that increasing g correlation should be associated with increasingly diverse patterns of neural activation. 

- The resulting study favored the hypothesis that select regions of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for tasks associated with a high g correlation. 

- One postulation posed within the paper is that high g correlation may very well correspond to a specific neural function, or in other words, there may be a fundemental process to cognitively intensive work. 

- I will add my own note that this paper studies the neural basis as it relates to the general phenomena, as you would if you were to study a strongly emergent phenomenon. I note this as this may provide insight for how we can analyze finer parts of intelligence. 

- I will include some images

	- The first image is the neural activity, the second is statistical data taken from the study.
