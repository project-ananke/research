## Quick Overview:  

	This area regards the neuroscientific basis for topics covered in Area 2. These include theories such as 2 factor theory, Gardeners multiple intelligence, triarchic theory of intelligence, Spearmans general intelligence, and Thurstones primary abilities, or special intelligence. Area 3 will also ideally include meassurements, that being emotional intelligence, fluid vs crystalized intelligence, Binet-Simon scale, Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, WISC, WIAS, they flynn effect, and apptitude vs acheivement, and counter arguments such as reliability vs construct validity, cultural specificity, social and enviromental factors, steryotype threat, and self fulfilling prochecies. There is not enough scientific litterature to account for each of these subjects, so some will be omitted. This area has gathered as much as I could find regarding the neural basis for the aforementioned topics.
