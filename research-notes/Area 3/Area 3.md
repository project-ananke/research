## Quick Overview:  

	This area regards the neuroscientific basis for topics covered in Area 2. These include theories such as 2 factor theory, Gardeners multiple intelligence, triarchic theory of intelligence, Spearmans general intelligence, and Thurstones primary abilities, or special intelligence. Area 3 will also ideally include meassurements, that being emotional intelligence, fluid vs crystalized intelligence, Binet-Simon scale, Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, WISC, WIAS, they flynn effect, and apptitude vs acheivement, and counter arguments such as reliability vs construct validity, cultural specificity, social and enviromental factors, steryotype threat, and self fulfilling prochecies. There is not enough scientific litterature to account for each of these subjects, so some will be omitted. This area has gathered as much as I could find regarding the neural basis for the aforementioned topics.  

## A Neural Basis for General Intelligence

- This study essentially works by using positron emmision topography to meassure the neural activation of different areas of the brain when performing high g tasks, this is meassured against the control task which are low g tasks. 

- Let us recall that the purpose of g factor is to explain the fact that people tend to *generally* do well in relating but not identicle tasks. 

- The main hypothesis tested by this study was to see whether high g correlation was associated with recruitment of the pre frontal cortex. 

- The alternate hypothesis to this was the Thomson hypothesis, that increasing g correlation should be associated with increasingly diverse patterns of neural activation. 

- The resulting study favored the hypothesis that select regions of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for tasks associated with a high g correlation. 

- One postulation posed within the paper is that high g correlation may very well correspond to a specific neural function, or in other words, there may be a fundemental process to cognitively intensive work. 

- I will add my own note that this paper studies the neural basis as it relates to the general phenomena, as you would if you were to study a strongly emergent phenomenon. I note this as this may provide insight for how we can analyze finer parts of intelligence. 

- I will include some images

	- The first image is the neural activity, the second is statistical data taken from the study.

## The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Empirical Support for the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

- Let us recall that Garndeners theory of multipple intelligences is as follows:
	
	- That intelligence is simply the ability to solve problems or create produces of value, which may take 8 forms. 
 
		     1. linguistical
		     2. logical-mathematical
			 3. visual-spacial
			 4. bodily-kinesthetic
			 5. musical
			 6. interpersonal
			 7. intrapersonal
			 8. naturalist

- The paper attempts to lay down to foundations to answer 3 unique question.					

	1. do neural functional strucutres and networks share coherance while being conceptually unique to other structures? 
	
	2. does the data describe a conceptual framework for the 8 types of intelligence? 
	
	3. how well do these neural architectures compare with the neural basis for general intelligence? 

- The paper mentions some important regions for research, they include the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, subcortical regions, and the cerebellum. 

- I will note that this paper is an amalgamation of a bunch of different studies, one regarding interpersonal intelligence showed activation in the frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, dorsolateral PFC, and the superior temporal sulcus. Other regions included the cingulate cortex, enterior cingulate cortex, and the parietal cortex. 

- Intraperson intelligence had the FC, PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and lateral PFC. Other notable regions were the cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, anterior temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem.

- Visual-spacial had the FC, PFC, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, dorsolateral PC, partial cortex, parietal cortex, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and the precuneus. Other notable regions were the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and the occipital cortex.

![[MI_VS-2.png]]



- Naturalist had the temporal cortex, anterior temporal sulcus, and amygdala. The brain stem and basal ganglia were also noted. 

![[MI_NTRL.png]]



- Musical had the FC, motor cortex, and pre motor cortex. The temporal cortex and superor temporal gyrus were also noted. Basal ganlgia and auditory cortex were also mentioned. 

![[MI_MUSIC.png]]



- Kinestetic had the FC, motor cortex, primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, parietal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the cerebellum. 

![[MI_KNSTH.png]]



- Linguistic had the temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, FC, inferior frontal gyrus, motor cortex, parietal cortex and the inferiro parietal lobule 

![[MI_LNGST.png]]



- Logical-mathematical has the FC, PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral PFC, Brocas Area, parietal cortex, interparietal cortex, interparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, parietal lobule, and the precuneus. 

![[MI_MATH-1.png]]

![[MI_MATH-2.png]]



- General intelligence had the FC, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. I will add that the paper noted that general intelligence and logical-mathematical intelligence depended heavily on planning, complex reasoning, mental visualization, verbal comprehension, and judgement. The paper also had the PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobal, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulat cortex.

- I will note that the paper organized these regions according to different levels on analysis and sorting them in accordance to the number of citations that each region revieved. 

- P-FIT is a commonly accepted neural model for general intelligence. 

- The paper states that there is suffecient evidence to support the claim that there are unique nerual structures for each of the 8 structures whilst them also sharing commonalities. 

- I will note an important excerpt from the paper located in the *Dicussion* section of the paper
	
		A detailed examination of three levels of neural analysis was employed in this review: primary, sub-regions and particular structures within sub-regions. The primary neural region analysis divided the brain into eight large neural regions (i.e., frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical structures) most frequently cited in the literature. Six of the eight intelligences were most associated with the frontal cortex, while the other two intelligences revealed the temporal cortex as most dominant (see Table 12). The parietal and cingulate cortices were the next most frequently associated with the intelligences. Alternatively, the cerebellum and insular cortex were never ranked within the top three most associated neural regions for any of the eight intelligences.

## The neural bases of key competencies of emotional intelligence

- The suggested location for neural functionality of EI is the PFC. 

- The way to meassure EI is through the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test.

- The study uses an interesting method, it analyzes brain injury to see where locations correspond to loss of functionality, it was found that the dorsolateral PFC is critical for EI. 

- The ventromedial PFC is considered crucial to EI. It is said to help mediate knowledge. Damage to this area of the brain can cause things like social incomptenance and changes to mood and personality. 

- The study states that there is suffecient evidence to suggest that disctinct neural substrates in the PFC are responsible for EI. 

- damages to the diPFC causes harm to experential EI and the ability to process emotional information. 

- I will include an important excerpt 

		Importantly, we stress that our findings highlight only two essential brain structures underlying key competencies of EI. Because vmPFC and dlPFC are higher-order association areas, it is likely that broadly distributed neural systems, incorporating subcortical limbic structures, such as the amygdala, which mediates emotional processes, and closely associated regions, such as the insula, cingulate cortex, and parietal cortices, which influence emotionally related behaviors (4, 37, 57, 58), will play important roles in subcomponents of EI. Future studies will need to examine each of these regions and their connectivity.

- I will also include an excerpt describing the statistical models used in the study for the sake of future use. 

		Statistical Analysis. Behavioral data analysis was carried out using SPSS 11.0 (www.spss.com; SPSS), and alpha was set to P 0.05 (two-tailed) for all analyses. Data were tested for Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and variance homogeneity (Bartlett’s test). Unless otherwise specified, data were normally distributed, and assumptions for analyses of variance were not violated. The Experiential and Strategic EI scores of the experimental groups were z-transformed in relation to normal group’s performance. A mixed two-way 2 (EI) 2 (group) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied with EI (Experiential versus Strategic) as a within-subject factor and Group (dlPFC versus vmPFC) as a between subject factor. Planned follow-up independent-samples t tests were applied to compare performances between the experimental groups.

## Crystallized and fluid intelligence are predicted by microstructure of specific white-matter tracts

- The paper suggests that there is a correlation between white-matter microstructural properties and (e.g. fractional anisotropy FA) and cognitive information processing speed and thus general intelligence. 

- I will note that multivariate analysis was used for certain studies. 

- The paper mainly talks about the application of models within the study to describe the correlation between white matter and GI and FI. I will close off by noting that there was a correlation between FA and the four cognitive domains associated with GI and FI. 

## The neuroscience of human intelligence differences 

- This paper regards the study of "differential neuro science."

- After reading the paper I can conclude that its contents mostly revolve around the investigation of different levels of intelligence based off genetic factors mainly, it speaks a bit on neuroscience but not in any substacial way, a lot of what is said regards to analysis of designing studies itself. 

- For future referance I will note the success of the P-FIT model, which models how intelligence is distributed within the brain. 

## Neural mechanisms of general fluid intelligence

- Interestingly enough, the difference method (neuro not math) was used to analyze the relation between regions of the brain with g-factor. 

- Lateral prefrontal and parietal regions may affect g-factor to a significant degree. 

- The lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, and lateral posterior cerebellum are some noted regions. 

- Ravens advanced progressive matrix was given whilst the subjects brains were scanned using fMRI. This allowed them to find locations which were significant.

![[FI_T1.png]]

- I will note that lure trials within the context of the paper are non-target trials. 

- As one practices and grows proffeciency with a skill, there is decreased activity in the lateral PFC, ACC (anterior cingulate cortex), and cerebellum 

- During the tests, these regions expierenced high activity during gF associated activities, there are several different explanations for this, one is that it was activated temporarily by the participants. 

- An important note is that *the most significant regions* were that in which gray matter was in high variability due to heredity. Notably, the lateral PFC. Heredity is not the end all be all contribution to this. 

- The paper mentions that over the course of human evolution, the size of our PFC increased in size, and that ours now is about twice as big as chimps. 



## Cultural and linguistic effects on neural bases of ‘Theory of Mind’ in American and Japanese children

- The theory of mind is essentially our ability to predict others behaviors based off their intentions. 


![[CE_1.png]]


- The paper states that people within western civilization tend to attribute behavior to internal causes whereas people within eastern civilization tend to attribute it to external and contextual causes. 

- The neural basis for ToM in general is the medial PFC, and the temporo-parietal junction. 

- The mPFC and ACC were found to be activated irrespective of culture or language.

- The images themself sum up all the important information regarding the neuroscience. I will conclude by noting that excessive knowledge in neuroscience, psychology, and statistics will be vital moving forward.
