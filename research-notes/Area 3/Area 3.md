## Quick Overview:  

	This area regards the neuroscientific basis for topics covered in Area 2. These include theories such as 2 factor theory, Gardeners multiple intelligence, triarchic theory of intelligence, Spearmans general intelligence, and Thurstones primary abilities, or special intelligence. Area 3 will also ideally include meassurements, that being emotional intelligence, fluid vs crystalized intelligence, Binet-Simon scale, Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, WISC, WIAS, they flynn effect, and apptitude vs acheivement, and counter arguments such as reliability vs construct validity, cultural specificity, social and enviromental factors, steryotype threat, and self fulfilling prochecies. There is not enough scientific litterature to account for each of these subjects, so some will be omitted. This area has gathered as much as I could find regarding the neural basis for the aforementioned topics.  

## A Neural Basis for General Intelligence

- This study essentially works by using positron emmision topography to meassure the neural activation of different areas of the brain when performing high g tasks, this is meassured against the control task which are low g tasks. 

- Let us recall that the purpose of g factor is to explain the fact that people tend to *generally* do well in relating but not identicle tasks. 

- The main hypothesis tested by this study was to see whether high g correlation was associated with recruitment of the pre frontal cortex. 

- The alternate hypothesis to this was the Thomson hypothesis, that increasing g correlation should be associated with increasingly diverse patterns of neural activation. 

- The resulting study favored the hypothesis that select regions of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for tasks associated with a high g correlation. 

- One postulation posed within the paper is that high g correlation may very well correspond to a specific neural function, or in other words, there may be a fundemental process to cognitively intensive work. 

- I will add my own note that this paper studies the neural basis as it relates to the general phenomena, as you would if you were to study a strongly emergent phenomenon. I note this as this may provide insight for how we can analyze finer parts of intelligence. 

- I will include some images

	- The first image is the neural activity, the second is statistical data taken from the study.

## The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Empirical Support for the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

- Let us recall that Garndeners theory of multipple intelligences is as follows:
	
	- That intelligence is simply the ability to solve problems or create produces of value, which may take 8 forms. 
 
		     1. linguistical
		     2. logical-mathematical
			 3. visual-spacial
			 4. bodily-kinesthetic
			 5. musical
			 6. interpersonal
			 7. intrapersonal
			 8. naturalist

- The paper attempts to lay down to foundations to answer 3 unique question.					

	1. do neural functional strucutres and networks share coherance while being conceptually unique to other structures? 
	
	2. does the data describe a conceptual framework for the 8 types of intelligence? 
	
	3. how well do these neural architectures compare with the neural basis for general intelligence? 

- The paper mentions some important regions for research, they include the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, subcortical regions, and the cerebellum. 

- I will note that this paper is an amalgamation of a bunch of different studies, one regarding interpersonal intelligence showed activation in the frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, dorsolateral PFC, and the superior temporal sulcus. Other regions included the cingulate cortex, enterior cingulate cortex, and the parietal cortex. 

- Intraperson intelligence had the FC, PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and lateral PFC. Other notable regions were the cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, anterior temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem.

![[MI_INTER-2.png]]



- Visual-spacial had the FC, PFC, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, dorsolateral PC, partial cortex, parietal cortex, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and the precuneus. Other notable regions were the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and the occipital cortex. 

![[MI_VS-1.png]]

![[MI_VS-2.png]]



- Naturalist had the temporal cortex, anterior temporal sulcus, and amygdala. The brain stem and basal ganglia were also noted. 

![[MI_NTRL.png]]



- Musical had the FC, motor cortex, and pre motor cortex. The temporal cortex and superor temporal gyrus were also noted. Basal ganlgia and auditory cortex were also mentioned. 

![[MI_MUSIC.png]]



- Kinestetic had the FC, motor cortex, primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, parietal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the cerebellum. 

![[MI_KNSTH.png]]



- Linguistic had the temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, FC, inferior frontal gyrus, motor cortex, parietal cortex and the inferiro parietal lobule 

![[MI_LNGST.png]]



- Logical-mathematical has the FC, PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral PFC, Brocas Area, parietal cortex, interparietal cortex, interparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, parietal lobule, and the precuneus. 

![[MI_MATH-1.png]]

![[MI_MATH-2.png]]



- General intelligence had the FC, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. I will add that the paper noted that general intelligence and logical-mathematical intelligence depended heavily on planning, complex reasoning, mental visualization, verbal comprehension, and judgement. The paper also had the PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobal, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulat cortex.

- I will note that the paper organized these regions according to different levels on analysis and sorting them in accordance to the number of citations that each region revieved. 

- P-FIT is a commonly accepted neural model for general intelligence. 

- The paper states that there is suffecient evidence to support the claim that there are unique nerual structures for each of the 8 structures whilst them also sharing commonalities. 

- I will note an important excerpt from the paper located in the *Dicussion* section of the paper
	
		A detailed examination of three levels of neural analysis was employed in this review: primary, sub-regions and particular structures within sub-regions. The primary neural region analysis divided the brain into eight large neural regions (i.e., frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical structures) most frequently cited in the literature. Six of the eight intelligences were most associated with the frontal cortex, while the other two intelligences revealed the temporal cortex as most dominant (see Table 12). The parietal and cingulate cortices were the next most frequently associated with the intelligences. Alternatively, the cerebellum and insular cortex were never ranked within the top three most associated neural regions for any of the eight intelligences.

## The neural bases of key competencies of emotional intelligence

- The suggested location for neural functionality of EI is the PFC. 

- The way to meassure EI is through the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test.

- The study uses an interesting method, it analyzes brain injury to see where locations correspond to loss of functionality, it was found that the dorsolateral PFC is critical for EI. 

- The ventromedial PFC is considered crucial to EI. It is said to help mediate knowledge. Damage to this area of the brain can cause things like social incomptenance and changes to mood and personality. 

- The study states that there is suffecient evidence to suggest that disctinct neural substrates in the PFC are responsible for EI. 

- damages to the diPFC causes harm to experential EI and the ability to process emotional information. 

- I will include an important excerpt 

		Importantly, we stress that our findings highlight only two essential brain structures underlying key competencies of EI. Because vmPFC and dlPFC are higher-order association areas, it is likely that broadly distributed neural systems, incorporating subcortical limbic structures, such as the amygdala, which mediates emotional processes, and closely associated regions, such as the insula, cingulate cortex, and parietal cortices, which influence emotionally related behaviors (4, 37, 57, 58), will play important roles in subcomponents of EI. Future studies will need to examine each of these regions and their connectivity.

- I will also include an excerpt describing the statistical models used in the study for the sake of future use. 

		Statistical Analysis. Behavioral data analysis was carried out using SPSS 11.0 (www.spss.com; SPSS), and alpha was set to P 0.05 (two-tailed) for all analyses. Data were tested for Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and variance homogeneity (Bartlett’s test). Unless otherwise specified, data were normally distributed, and assumptions for analyses of variance were not violated. The Experiential and Strategic EI scores of the experimental groups were z-transformed in relation to normal group’s performance. A mixed two-way 2 (EI) 2 (group) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied with EI (Experiential versus Strategic) as a within-subject factor and Group (dlPFC versus vmPFC) as a between subject factor. Planned follow-up independent-samples t tests were applied to compare performances between the experimental groups.

## Crystallized and fluid intelligence are predicted by microstructure of specific white-matter tracts

- The paper suggests that there is a correlation between white-matter microstructural properties and (e.g. fractional anisotropy FA) and cognitive information processing speed and thus general intelligence. 

- I will note that multivariate analysis was used for certain studies. 

- The paper mainly talks about the application of models within the study to describe the correlation between white matter and GI and FI. I will close off by noting that there was a correlation between FA and the four cognitive domains associated with GI and FI. 

## The neuroscience of human intelligence differences 

- This paper regards the study of "differential neuro science."

- After reading the paper I can conclude that its contents mostly revolve around the investigation of different levels of intelligence based off genetic factors mainly, it speaks a bit on neuroscience but not in any substacial way, a lot of what is said regards to analysis of designing studies itself. 

- For future referance I will note the success of the P-FIT model, which models how intelligence is distributed within the brain. 

## Neural mechanisms of general fluid intelligence

- Interestingly enough, the difference method (neuro not math) was used to analyze the relation between regions of the brain with g-factor. 

- Lateral prefrontal and parietal regions may affect g-factor to a significant degree. 

- The lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, and lateral posterior cerebellum are some noted regions. 

- Ravens advanced progressive matrix was given whilst the subjects brains were scanned using fMRI. This allowed them to find locations which were significant. 


![[FI_1.png]]


![[FI_2.png]]


![[FI_3.png]]


![[FI_T1.png]]

- I will note that lure trials within the context of the paper are non-target trials. 

- As one practices and grows proffeciency with a skill, there is decreased activity in the lateral PFC, ACC (anterior cingulate cortex), and cerebellum 

- During the tests, these regions expierenced high activity during gF associated activities, there are several different explanations for this, one is that it was activated temporarily by the participants. 

- An important note is that *the most significant regions* were that in which gray matter was in high variability due to heredity. Notably, the lateral PFC. Heredity is not the end all be all contribution to this. 

- The paper mentions that over the course of human evolution, the size of our PFC increased in size, and that ours now is about twice as big as chimps. 



## Cultural and linguistic effects on neural bases of ‘Theory of Mind’ in American and Japanese children

- The theory of mind is essentially our ability to predict others behaviors based off their intentions. 


![[CE_1.png]]


- The paper states that people within western civilization tend to attribute behavior to internal causes whereas people within eastern civilization tend to attribute it to external and contextual causes. 

- The neural basis for ToM in general is the medial PFC, and the temporo-parietal junction. 

- The mPFC and ACC were found to be activated irrespective of culture or language. 


![[ToF_1.png]]


![[ToF_2.png]]

- The images themself sum up all the important information regarding the neuroscience. I will conclude by noting that excessive knowledge in neuroscience, psychology, and statistics will be vital moving forward. 


## The Social Brain: Neural Basis of Social Knowledge

- Social cognition is the collective psychological processes that allow humans to interpret whats going on in someone else's head. 

- The paper notes that other animals such as primates exhibit complicated social behavior, though of course, not to our level. 

- An interesting argument is that animals that show behavior in which they decieve others could only be possible if they had some understanding of what the other animal knew, and thus they showcase social cognition and ToM. 

- I will note that it is not defintively known as to whether chimps can pass the social cognition test. 

- Episodic memory is a key component in social knowledge, as it allows for past expierences to be processed as information such that we may use it to adjust our behaviors. 

- An interesting component is that of future episodic planning, or basically just planning, this was discussed further in Area 1. 

- A complicated strucutre is that of self knowledge, almost like metacognition 

- The main difference between social cognition and ToM has to do with the interpratation of emotion, ToM suggests that you can figure out emotions and internal states simply based off apearance. 

- Because of the complex social structures present in human society, we can conclude that inner functionality within humans is significantly differant than apes. 

- Apes have inner functions that relate more to competition than cooperation. 

- Humans have "moral emotions" that cause us to behave more complexly. 

- There are controlled procosses and automatic ones, controlled are more effortful and thoughtful whereas automatic are just automatic. Social cognition is somewhat automatic, somewhat controlled. 

- One complicated aspect of humans is that we deploy behavior strategically. Some examples being the withold of plessure now for plessure later, and the controlling of ones emotions. 

- An interesting result of social cognition is the ability to judge peoples morals and virtues. I will also note that *cognitive psychology* and *neuroscience* are important fields revevant in this paper. *neurobiology* is also breifly mentioned. 

- An important question raised is whether complicated social cognition yielded intelligence, or whether intelligence yielded complicated social cognition. This question leads to something called *The Social Brain Hypothesis*, which essentially states that we became intelligent as to handle complicated social structures. 

- There are 4 aspects to human cognition. 
	1. Identification of social signals such as faces or gestures. 
	
	2. Rapid integration of memory, like who is friend, foe, etc. 
	
	3. To predict social behavior as a response to competition. 
	
	4. The generation of normative evaluation. Such as altruistic punishment (or basically just external social structures and morals)

- A subcortical route through the superior colliculus is thought to contribute to visual processing. 


![[SK_1.png]]

- Damage to the amygdala results in impairment in the ability to recognize faces. 

- The ventromedial PFC is crucial to emotional regulation. There have been many cases of peopl recieving damage to that part of the brain and getting their personalities changed as a result. It does not change actual intelligence though apparently. 

- Damage to the VMPFC also hurts the ability to deduce emotion in emotionally charged images.

- The *somatic maker hypothesis* suggests that VMPFC can help with future planning as a result of emotional deductive abilities. 

- Empathy is controlled by an important region called the insula. You may see activation in the insula with something such as a shock to a loved ones hand. 

- The anterior cingulate cortex is one region of the brain thought to help support the transmission of complicated data to understand actual and predicted sensory events. 

- There are 9 summary points which I will include as an excerpt: 
	
	1. Inferring what is going on inside other people’s minds from their observed behavior may be a uniquely human ability, although other primates show precursors to this ability. 
	
	2. The ability to infer others’ mental states is thought to be an important contributor to human culture and civilization. www.annualreviews.org • The Social Brain 709 Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2009.60:693-716. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by University of Regina on 04/14/13. For personal use only. 
	
	3. Although many different psychological processes contribute to social cognition, they are often grouped into two broad categories: those related to automatic processing driven more by the stimuli and those related to controlled processing driven more by the person’s goals and intentions. 
	
	4. Social information processing looks in many respects different from nonsocial information processing. This has provided support for some schemes that claim social information processing is modular. 
	
	5. The amygdala is a structure in the medial temporal lobe important to regulating social behavior and recognizing emotional facial expressions. However, recent work suggests its role is quite abstract and not specific to social cognition. 
	
	6. The orbitofrontal cortex is a region of cortex in the frontal lobes that is involved in reward processing. Lesions of this region in humans result in severe impairments in real-life social behavior despite cognition in other domains that is otherwise relatively intact. 
	
	7. The insula is a region of cortex buried underneath the frontal cortex that is involved in representing states of our own body, such as pain. It is also involved when we feel empathy for others, such as when we observe somebody else in pain. 
	
	8. Social cognition is sensitive to context, and the brain regions involved in social cognition are modulated in their activation by social context and volitional regulation. 
	
	9. Two hypotheses about how we infer other people’s mental states are that we do so by simulation and empathy (abilities that involve regions such as the premotor cortex and the insula) or via more deliberate theory-of-mind abilities (which involve regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction).
