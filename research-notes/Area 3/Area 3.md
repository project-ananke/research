## Quick Overview:  

	This area regards the neuroscientific basis for topics covered in Area 2. These include theories such as 2 factor theory, Gardeners multiple intelligence, triarchic theory of intelligence, Spearmans general intelligence, and Thurstones primary abilities, or special intelligence. Area 3 will also ideally include meassurements, that being emotional intelligence, fluid vs crystalized intelligence, Binet-Simon scale, Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, WISC, WIAS, they flynn effect, and apptitude vs acheivement, and counter arguments such as reliability vs construct validity, cultural specificity, social and enviromental factors, steryotype threat, and self fulfilling prochecies. There is not enough scientific litterature to account for each of these subjects, so some will be omitted. This area has gathered as much as I could find regarding the neural basis for the aforementioned topics.  

## A Neural Basis for General Intelligence

- This study essentially works by using positron emmision topography to meassure the neural activation of different areas of the brain when performing high g tasks, this is meassured against the control task which are low g tasks. 

- Let us recall that the purpose of g factor is to explain the fact that people tend to *generally* do well in relating but not identicle tasks. 

- The main hypothesis tested by this study was to see whether high g correlation was associated with recruitment of the pre frontal cortex. 

- The alternate hypothesis to this was the Thomson hypothesis, that increasing g correlation should be associated with increasingly diverse patterns of neural activation. 

- The resulting study favored the hypothesis that select regions of the prefrontal cortex are recruited for tasks associated with a high g correlation. 

- One postulation posed within the paper is that high g correlation may very well correspond to a specific neural function, or in other words, there may be a fundemental process to cognitively intensive work. 

- I will add my own note that this paper studies the neural basis as it relates to the general phenomena, as you would if you were to study a strongly emergent phenomenon. I note this as this may provide insight for how we can analyze finer parts of intelligence. 

- I will include some images

	- The first image is the neural activity, the second is statistical data taken from the study.

## The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Empirical Support for the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

- Let us recall that Garndeners theory of multipple intelligences is as follows:
	
	- That intelligence is simply the ability to solve problems or create produces of value, which may take 8 forms. 
 
		     1. linguistical
		     2. logical-mathematical
			 3. visual-spacial
			 4. bodily-kinesthetic
			 5. musical
			 6. interpersonal
			 7. intrapersonal
			 8. naturalist

- The paper attempts to lay down to foundations to answer 3 unique question.					

	1. do neural functional strucutres and networks share coherance while being conceptually unique to other structures? 
	
	2. does the data describe a conceptual framework for the 8 types of intelligence? 
	
	3. how well do these neural architectures compare with the neural basis for general intelligence? 

- The paper mentions some important regions for research, they include the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, subcortical regions, and the cerebellum. 

- I will note that this paper is an amalgamation of a bunch of different studies, one regarding interpersonal intelligence showed activation in the frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, dorsolateral PFC, and the superior temporal sulcus. Other regions included the cingulate cortex, enterior cingulate cortex, and the parietal cortex. 

- Intraperson intelligence had the FC, PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and lateral PFC. Other notable regions were the cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, medial temporal lobe, amygdala, anterior temporal cortex, basal ganglia, and brain stem.

- Visual-spacial had the FC, PFC, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, dorsolateral PC, partial cortex, parietal cortex, intraparietal sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and the precuneus. Other notable regions were the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and the occipital cortex.

- Naturalist had the temporal cortex, anterior temporal sulcus, and amygdala. The brain stem and basal ganglia were also noted. 

![[MI_NTRL.png]]



- Musical had the FC, motor cortex, and pre motor cortex. The temporal cortex and superor temporal gyrus were also noted. Basal ganlgia and auditory cortex were also mentioned. 

![[MI_MUSIC.png]]



- Kinestetic had the FC, motor cortex, primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, parietal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the cerebellum. 

![[MI_KNSTH.png]]



- Linguistic had the temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, FC, inferior frontal gyrus, motor cortex, parietal cortex and the inferiro parietal lobule 

![[MI_LNGST.png]]



- Logical-mathematical has the FC, PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral PFC, Brocas Area, parietal cortex, interparietal cortex, interparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, parietal lobule, and the precuneus. 

![[MI_MATH-1.png]]

- General intelligence had the FC, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum. I will add that the paper noted that general intelligence and logical-mathematical intelligence depended heavily on planning, complex reasoning, mental visualization, verbal comprehension, and judgement. The paper also had the PFC, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobal, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulat cortex.

- I will note that the paper organized these regions according to different levels on analysis and sorting them in accordance to the number of citations that each region revieved. 

- P-FIT is a commonly accepted neural model for general intelligence. 

- The paper states that there is suffecient evidence to support the claim that there are unique nerual structures for each of the 8 structures whilst them also sharing commonalities. 

- I will note an important excerpt from the paper located in the *Dicussion* section of the paper
	
		A detailed examination of three levels of neural analysis was employed in this review: primary, sub-regions and particular structures within sub-regions. The primary neural region analysis divided the brain into eight large neural regions (i.e., frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, cingulate cortex, insular cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical structures) most frequently cited in the literature. Six of the eight intelligences were most associated with the frontal cortex, while the other two intelligences revealed the temporal cortex as most dominant (see Table 12). The parietal and cingulate cortices were the next most frequently associated with the intelligences. Alternatively, the cerebellum and insular cortex were never ranked within the top three most associated neural regions for any of the eight intelligences.
