- The paper suggests that there is a correlation between white-matter microstructural properties and (e.g. fractional anisotropy FA) and cognitive information processing speed and thus general intelligence. 

- I will note that multivariate analysis was used for certain studies. 

- The paper mainly talks about the application of models within the study to describe the correlation between white matter and GI and FI. I will close off by noting that there was a correlation between FA and the four cognitive domains associated with GI and FI.
