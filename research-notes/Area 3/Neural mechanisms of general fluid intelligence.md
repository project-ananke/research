- Interestingly enough, the difference method (neuro not math) was used to analyze the relation between regions of the brain with g-factor. 

- Lateral prefrontal and parietal regions may affect g-factor to a significant degree. 

- The lateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate, and lateral posterior cerebellum are some noted regions. 

- Ravens advanced progressive matrix was given whilst the subjects brains were scanned using fMRI. This allowed them to find locations which were significant.

- I will note that lure trials within the context of the paper are non-target trials. 

- As one practices and grows proffeciency with a skill, there is decreased activity in the lateral PFC, ACC (anterior cingulate cortex), and cerebellum 

- During the tests, these regions expierenced high activity during gF associated activities, there are several different explanations for this, one is that it was activated temporarily by the participants. 

- An important note is that *the most significant regions* were that in which gray matter was in high variability due to heredity. Notably, the lateral PFC. Heredity is not the end all be all contribution to this. 

- The paper mentions that over the course of human evolution, the size of our PFC increased in size, and that ours now is about twice as big as chimps.
