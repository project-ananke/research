- This paper regards the study of "differential neuro science."

- After reading the paper I can conclude that its contents mostly revolve around the investigation of different levels of intelligence based off genetic factors mainly, it speaks a bit on neuroscience but not in any substacial way, a lot of what is said regards to analysis of designing studies itself. 

- For future referance I will note the success of the P-FIT model, which models how intelligence is distributed within the brain.
