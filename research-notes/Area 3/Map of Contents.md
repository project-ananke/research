## A Neural Basis for General Intelligence

- PET scans were used on the brain to map neural activity whilst subjects were given tasks associated with high g. g factor being a theory of general intelligence (see Area 2).

## The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Empirical Support for the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

- This paper is the accumulation of multiple papers regarding the theory of multiple intelligences. It basically sums up all the information regarding regions of the brain associated with the 8 different intelligences.

## The neural bases of key competencies of emotional intelligence

- This study regards the neural basis for EI, it does this through methods of analyzing behavior in relation to damaged parts of the brain.

## Crystallized and fluid intelligence are predicted by microstructure of specific white-matter tracts

- This paper is about the statistical analysis of the relation between white matter tracts and intelligence, it was very complicated and most of it revolved around the actual methodology rather than results, so not much was included.

## The neuroscience of human intelligence differences 

- This paper mainly revolved around the genetic influences of intelligence and various statistical models, I was unfortunately limited in the value I could extract from the paper due to its complexcity.

## Neural mechanisms of general fluid intelligence

- This paper mainly talks about the neural activity in the brain as subjects do various tasks that require g factor.

## Cultural and linguistic effects on neural bases of ‘Theory of Mind’ in American and Japanese children

- This paper talks about the difference in activations in regions associated with functions within ToM, it compared groups of American and Japanese children, essentially to see whether culture affected the fundemental structure of social cognition itself.

## The Social Brain: Neural Basis of Social Knowledge

- This paper covers social cognition, ToM, and other social functions as they exist within regions in the brain. It allows insight into what specific regions are assosiated with specific functions, such as telling faces apart, reading social cues, etc.
