- Social cognition is the collective psychological processes that allow humans to interpret whats going on in someone else's head. 

- The paper notes that other animals such as primates exhibit complicated social behavior, though of course, not to our level. 

- An interesting argument is that animals that show behavior in which they decieve others could only be possible if they had some understanding of what the other animal knew, and thus they showcase social cognition and ToM. 

- I will note that it is not defintively known as to whether chimps can pass the social cognition test. 

- Episodic memory is a key component in social knowledge, as it allows for past expierences to be processed as information such that we may use it to adjust our behaviors. 

- An interesting component is that of future episodic planning, or basically just planning, this was discussed further in Area 1. 

- A complicated strucutre is that of self knowledge, almost like metacognition 

- The main difference between social cognition and ToM has to do with the interpratation of emotion, ToM suggests that you can figure out emotions and internal states simply based off apearance. 

- Because of the complex social structures present in human society, we can conclude that inner functionality within humans is significantly differant than apes. 

- Apes have inner functions that relate more to competition than cooperation. 

- Humans have "moral emotions" that cause us to behave more complexly. 

- There are controlled procosses and automatic ones, controlled are more effortful and thoughtful whereas automatic are just automatic. Social cognition is somewhat automatic, somewhat controlled. 

- One complicated aspect of humans is that we deploy behavior strategically. Some examples being the withold of plessure now for plessure later, and the controlling of ones emotions. 

- An interesting result of social cognition is the ability to judge peoples morals and virtues. I will also note that *cognitive psychology* and *neuroscience* are important fields revevant in this paper. *neurobiology* is also breifly mentioned. 

- An important question raised is whether complicated social cognition yielded intelligence, or whether intelligence yielded complicated social cognition. This question leads to something called *The Social Brain Hypothesis*, which essentially states that we became intelligent as to handle complicated social structures. 

- There are 4 aspects to human cognition. 
	1. Identification of social signals such as faces or gestures. 
	
	2. Rapid integration of memory, like who is friend, foe, etc. 
	
	3. To predict social behavior as a response to competition. 
	
	4. The generation of normative evaluation. Such as altruistic punishment (or basically just external social structures and morals)

- A subcortical route through the superior colliculus is thought to contribute to visual processing.

- Damage to the amygdala results in impairment in the ability to recognize faces. 

- The ventromedial PFC is crucial to emotional regulation. There have been many cases of peopl recieving damage to that part of the brain and getting their personalities changed as a result. It does not change actual intelligence though apparently. 

- Damage to the VMPFC also hurts the ability to deduce emotion in emotionally charged images.

- The *somatic maker hypothesis* suggests that VMPFC can help with future planning as a result of emotional deductive abilities. 

- Empathy is controlled by an important region called the insula. You may see activation in the insula with something such as a shock to a loved ones hand. 

- The anterior cingulate cortex is one region of the brain thought to help support the transmission of complicated data to understand actual and predicted sensory events. 

- There are 9 summary points which I will include as an excerpt: 
	
	1. Inferring what is going on inside other people’s minds from their observed behavior may be a uniquely human ability, although other primates show precursors to this ability. 
	
	2. The ability to infer others’ mental states is thought to be an important contributor to human culture and civilization. www.annualreviews.org • The Social Brain 709 Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2009.60:693-716. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by University of Regina on 04/14/13. For personal use only. 
	
	3. Although many different psychological processes contribute to social cognition, they are often grouped into two broad categories: those related to automatic processing driven more by the stimuli and those related to controlled processing driven more by the person’s goals and intentions. 
	
	4. Social information processing looks in many respects different from nonsocial information processing. This has provided support for some schemes that claim social information processing is modular. 
	
	5. The amygdala is a structure in the medial temporal lobe important to regulating social behavior and recognizing emotional facial expressions. However, recent work suggests its role is quite abstract and not specific to social cognition. 
	
	6. The orbitofrontal cortex is a region of cortex in the frontal lobes that is involved in reward processing. Lesions of this region in humans result in severe impairments in real-life social behavior despite cognition in other domains that is otherwise relatively intact. 
	
	7. The insula is a region of cortex buried underneath the frontal cortex that is involved in representing states of our own body, such as pain. It is also involved when we feel empathy for others, such as when we observe somebody else in pain. 
	
	8. Social cognition is sensitive to context, and the brain regions involved in social cognition are modulated in their activation by social context and volitional regulation. 
	
	9. Two hypotheses about how we infer other people’s mental states are that we do so by simulation and empathy (abilities that involve regions such as the premotor cortex and the insula) or via more deliberate theory-of-mind abilities (which involve regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction).
