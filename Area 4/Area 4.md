## Notes Taken From Sapolsky Lectures: 

 
 - The rediscovery of logic spiked up a revolution within Europe.

- Reductionism: to understand a complex system break it down into its fundementals. 
Starting state of a complex system allows for causality. Reductive systems allow you to use causality to just explain things that are complex 
given an already known variable. Reductionism reduces variability. An interesting note is that certain biological structures have reductionism, 
an example being neurons in the visual cortex and retina cells corresponding to eachother.

 - Sequential reductivity can allow for complex behavior,
an example is the "grandmother neuron" this is called sparse coding. Reductionism breaks down when you get to bifurcation and recognition, simply put the system branches out to a degree where there aren't enough neurons or genes to account for it, therefore reductionism breaks down. Chance 
also breaks down reductionism. Reductionism breaks down at a lot of natural occurrences. 

 - Chaos is the absence of periodicity. An interesting note is that odd number of repitions in a cycle implies chaos. Modification to system cause it 
to converge back to the ideal state of the system. One graphical representation of chaos is this type of butterfly pattern. 
#1:10:25 

 - The butterfly affect suggest that minor changes can cause massive outcomes. A fractal is a scale free pattern. Fractals are important as they can 
set rules that are independent of scale. The fractal interpretation bassicly describes variance as a part of the system.

 - One interesting study is: 
	to study variation at different levels, like from  behavior to physiology to organs to cells, the coefficient of variation was fairly constant, 
	there was no trend of variability decreasing, thus a proof against reducibility because it is a fractal systems. 


 - Cellular automata are a good representation of fractals. Most ca have random patterns or patterns that end, ca are bassicly non linear systems, 
the initial state is not enough to predict the future. There are extinction where patterns die. Different starting states and rules produce vastly 
different results. Some patterns converge, for example completely unrelated plants converging to the same shape. Apparently you can predict 
divergence and convergence within ca. Networks, as in neural networks is what allows for pattern recognition. 

 -  tree biphorcation is based on fractal genes, when branches get a certain size one splits off and grows to a certain length or something like that. #36:33 fractals also create
impossible shapes that exist between 1 and 2 dimensions, or so I heard. They are impossible as they can have infinite points so like an infinite 
perimeter whilst also taking up a finite space. This is how you get structures like the circulatory systems which is virtually everywhere but takes 
up very little space. The average of guesses between experts on some problem is usually correct, this is described as wisdom of the crowd. 
	Shortest possible path problems can be solved with virtual ants, essentially a bunch of swarms that over several generations show the most 
	intelligent path, swarm intelligence. You can also have attractive repulsion rules, so like competitive stores are all not so close to each other

## Emergence: 
 - Many dumb, simple things, can create very complicated and sophisticated 
	systems. It is complexity arrises from simplicity. An example being the 
	intelligent strucutre of a bunch of dumb and simple ants. The properties 
	of water is also a good example, the properties of individual molecules 
	make up complex behavior. This is essentially done through simple rules.
	The cells within our bodies just act based on rules, they dont have some master
	control system.  

 -  I will list spme examples of emergence 
	 -  snow flake formations 
	
	 - magnetic behavior from atomic alignments 
	
	 - weather patterns or just weather in general 
	
	 - bird formations
	
	 -  properties of crystal lattice structures

		

 - The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is stated that phenomona such as life and intelligence can be explained through emergence. 

- Most scientists view more complex emergence as phase transitions, an example being literal phase transitions, the rules of how atoms interact with eachother can cause it to change phases depending on the enviroment around it. 

- Another interesting example is the bridge structure of ants. Basically, ants maintain a close distance with its neighbors, thus when they cross some open area, lets say across two leaves seperated by some distance, then the rule of closenss causes them to actually bridge across. This is also when ants fall down, they form a tight knit group because of these old rules. 

- Emergence is being used as a framework for areas of science, some examples being the firing of neurons, the movement of cells (during organ growth), and even engineering. 

- Condensed matter physics is a prime field for emergence. One example being the propogation of waves within condensed matter systems. Quantum mechanical systems also have particles being wave like structures. 

- Condensed matter physics has something called quasi-particles, they are essentially particles that behave like particles, but still have wave behavior, and also be a collective system that moves together. 

- Conductivity is an emergent property, aswell as color, viscosity, and much more. These are not properties that can be analyzed on the scale of the atom, they are properties that can only be observed from the system as a whole. 

- There is strong emergence and weak emergence. 

- Weak emergence means that the property of emergence can be derived from the properties of its constituents. An example being conductivity. 

- Weak emergence is alway found in physics, in fact, all emergent properties within physics fall under weak emergence. 

- Strong emergence describes that it is possible that systems with many constituents displace the novel behavior of its constituents, thus making a property that can not be derived from its constituents. 

- Strong emergence does not occur within nature, but it can be artificially created. An example being photographic mosaics. Given a bunch of pictures you cannot tell what the emergent mosaic would look like. 

- There is no scientific basis for strong emergence, mainly as this type of emergence entails that there exists objects which go against the standard model of particle physics. 

- Some think that conciousness and intelligence are strongly emergent, but there is no evidence for this and most believe the contrary, that it is weakly emergent. 

- One way to think about emergence is like layers being stacked on eachother. Each layer coincides with increased complexcity and new phenomena.
